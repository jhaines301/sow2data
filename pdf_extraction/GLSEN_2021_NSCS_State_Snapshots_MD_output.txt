School Climate for LGBTQ+ Students in Maryland

Findings from the GLSEN 2021 National School Climate Survey demonstrate that Maryland 
schools were not safe for most LGBTQ+ secondary school students. In addition, many LGBTQ+ 
students in Maryland did not have access to important school supports. Of note, the 2020-2021 
school year was unique in that the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to schools across 
the country, as schools had to adapt in the wake of the pandemic, drastically changing how 
many students experienced school; in Maryland, 1% of LGBTQ+ students attended school only 
in-person, 45% attended only online, and 54% attended school in a hybrid setting. 

The vast majority of LGBTQ+ students in Maryland regularly (sometimes, often, or frequently) heard anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks (Fig. 1). Many also regularly heard school staff make homophobic remarks (51.5%) and negative remarks 
about someone’s gender expression (70.4%). 

Most LGBTQ+ students in Maryland experienced anti-LGBTQ+ victimization at school (Fig. 2). They also experienced 
victimization at school based on religion (18.8%), disability (24.6%), and race/ethnicity (23.5%). Most never reported the 
incident to school staff (64.3%), and of those who had, only 26.4% of LGBTQ+ students said that it resulted in effective 
staff intervention.

Many LGBTQ+ students in Maryland did not have access to in-school resources and supports (Fig. 4).

of LGBTQ+ students.

51.6% had access to inclusive library resources, and 9.6% of LGBTQ+ students in Maryland reported receiving  
LGBTQ+-inclusive sex education at school.

RECOMMENDATIONS 

Findings from the 2021 National School Climate Survey demonstrate that students attending schools with affirming  
LGBTQ+ resources and supports report more positive school experiences, including lower victimization and absenteeism,  
and higher academic achievement.

Given the high percentages of LGBTQ+ students in Maryland who experience harassment at school, and the limited  
access to key resources and supports, it is critical that Maryland school leaders, education policymakers, and  
other individuals who are obligated to provide safe learning environments for all students take the following steps:

•  Implement supportive and inclusive school policies, such as comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment and 

supportive transgender and nonbinary student policies; 

•  Support GSAs;

•  Provide professional development for school staff on LGBTQ+ student issues; and

•  Increase student access to LGBTQ+-inclusive curricular resources.

ABOUT THE RESEARCH 

In 2021, GLSEN conducted the eleventh National School Climate Survey, a biennial survey of the experiences of LGBTQ+ youth in U.S. 
secondary schools. The national sample consisted of 22,298 LGBTQ+ students from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 
American Samoa, and Guam. A total of 454 respondents were attending schools in Maryland. The Maryland sample was 5% AAPI  (Asian 
American/Pacific Islander), 11% Black, 9% Latinx, 1% MENA (Middle Eastern and North African), 12% multiracial, 0% Native or Indigenous, 
and 62% white. The gender composition was 35% cisgender, 28% transgender, 30% nonbinary or genderqueer, and 7% questioning. 90% 
attended public schools and 5% attended a religious-affiliated school. The school community makeup was 26% rural/small town, 58.4% 
suburban, and 16% urban. The results reported for Maryland had a margin of error of +/- 5%.
