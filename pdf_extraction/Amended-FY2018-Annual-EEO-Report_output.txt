SECTION 1:  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Commitment to Equal Employment Opportunity 

The State recognizes and honors the value and dignity of every person and understands the 

importance of providing employees and applicants for employment with a fair opportunity to pursue 
their careers in an environment free of discrimination, retaliation and/or harassment prohibited by 
law.  The State is committed to ensuring a system based on merit that provides equal opportunity in 
employment on the basis of merit and fitness, without regard to an individual’s age, ancestry, color, 
creed, gender identity and expression, genetic information, marital status, mental or physical 
disability, national origin, race, religious affiliation, belief or opinion, sex, or sexual orientation and 
any other non-merit factor.  Each State employee is expected to assume personal responsibility and 
leadership in ensuring fair employment practices and equal employment opportunity (EEO) in 
Maryland State government. 

In accordance with the terms of the Annotated Code of Maryland State Personnel and 
Pensions Article, Title 5, Subtitle 2, the Office of the Statewide EEO Coordinator (OSEEOC), 
under the direction of the Secretary of the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has been 
charged with overseeing and implementing the administration of the equal employment practices 
program to ensure compliance with the requirements of applicable State and federal laws governing 
equal employment opportunity.  The OSEEOC is committed to its mission to administer and 
enforce State and federal EEO laws and policies; promote a work environment free of any unlawful 
discrimination, harassment and retaliation; and assist in the building of a well-diversified workforce 
of Maryland State government employees and applicants. 

This report provides information necessary to effectively access the State’s EEO program 
through the analysis of statistical and demographical data for Fiscal Year 2018 and to reflect the 
achievements and ongoing progress of our State government.  The OSEEOC has prepared this 
report, which covers the period July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018.  This report contains selected 
measures outlining the progress towards equal opportunity in Maryland government and assesses 
the State’s EEO Program. 

2018 EEO Highlights 

During calendar 2018, the Office of the Statewide EEO Coordinator engaged State agencies 
and the State’s EEO professionals in a number of EEO program activities and assisted agencies in 
becoming model employers.  The office continues to focus on compliance, training, outreach, and 
diversity awareness.   

In order to ensure compliance with State and federal EEO laws, policies and practices, the 
OSEEOC  has  continued  to  conduct  ongoing  compliance  audits  to  review  and  monitor  the  EEO 
programs  in  each  State  agency.    The  office  conducted  12  agency  compliance  audits  in  2018  and 

4 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided  each  agency  with  an  exit  report  detailing  compliance  concerns,  as  well  as  potential 
improvements to their EEO programs.   

Through enhanced training and outreach activities, the office strove to increase the skills and 

knowledge of the State’s EEO professionals.  Specific activities included: 

  Refresher training on EEO laws, diversity, and investigative techniques for State  EEO and 

Fair Practices Officers. 

  Ongoing guidance and training to Americans with Disabilities Act coordinators. 

  Continuous updates to DBM/OSEEOC’s web page to ensure we disseminate the most 

current EEO related laws, policies and resources. 

  Continuation of the EEO Connection  – a quarterly EEO newsletter that  includes EEO law 
updates, noteworthy court rulings, a diversity corner, community awareness information and 
a new section for frequently asked questions with answers. 

 

In collaboration with Maryland Commission on Civil Rights, work to coordinate and 
implement Sexual Harassment Prevention workshops and Sexual Harassment Prevention 
Train the Trainer sessions for EEO professionals in response to 2018 HB 1423 – Sexual 
Harassment Prevention Training - Required. Training covers applicable laws, prevention, 
employer liability, case examples and best practices to prevent and respond to sexual 
harassment cases. 

  A movie and discussion series that showcase films that include an EEO component.  

  Provide guidance and technical assistance to agency Fair Practices, EEO and ADA officers 

and other agency officials and employees. 

  Provide training and instruction on non-visual access for individuals with sight impairments.  

During 2019 the office intends to continue training for EEO professionals across the State, 
conducting  compliance audits  of agency EEO efforts  to  ensure consistency  with  State and federal 
reporting requirements, producing and distributing educational material to ensure that all employees 
fully  understand  their  rights  and  protections,  and  investigating  agency  appeal  and  whistleblower 
complaints. 

Data Analysis 

Detailed  EEO  statistical  and  demographic  workforce  data  for  fiscal  2018  and  trends  since 
fiscal 2013 are presented in Sections 3-10.  Notable findings and trends are discussed briefly below.

Workforce Diversity 

Maryland  State  government  employs  individuals  from  a  wide  range  of  racial  and  ethnic 
groups.  Minorities make up over half of the State’s workforce (Exhibit 1) and African Americans 
represent  a  larger  share  of  the  State  government’s  workforce  compared  to  Maryland’s  Civilian 
Labor Force (CLF), (Exhibit 2).  Minorities represent a slightly larger share of State government’s 
workforce than in 2013, while the percentage of females is nearly the same at 56% (Exhibit 3).  

During fiscal 2018, new hires continued to add to the diversity of the workforce with women 
accounting for 56% of new hires, minorities accounting for more than half and African-Americans 
accounting for 45% (Exhibits 4 and 5).  In each of the last five years, women and minorities each 
have represented more than half of all new hires. 

Favorable trends in minority hiring are reflected in the demographics of the State workforce 
by age. Approximately 44% of State workers under the age of 50 are African-American.   African-
Americans make up 44% of workers between 50-59, and 38% of workers age 60+ (Exhibit 6)1.     

Advancement Opportunities 

In  fiscal  2018,  women  and  minorities  generally  received  promotions  or  upward 
reclassifications at rates consistent with their share of the workforce.  Women – who represent 56% 
of  the  workforce  -  accounted  for  49%  of  all  promotions  and  60%  of  reclassifications.    African-
Americans – who represent 44% of the workforce – accounted for 39% of the promotions and 40% 
of the reclassifications (Exhibit 7).   

Disciplinary Personnel  Transactions 

African-Americans were over-represented with respect to terminations (60%) in fiscal 2018. 
The percentage of suspensions for African-Americans has increased from 63% in 2017 to 65% in 
2018.  The  percentage  of  African  American  disciplinary  demotions  decreased  from  66%  in  fiscal 
2017 to 45% in fiscal 2018 (Exhibit 8). 

Disparities Remain 

Although  women  and  minorities  are  well  represented  in  State  government,  significant 
disparities  remain  between  the  genders  and  races  with  respect  to  employment  responsibilities  and 
pay.    Whites,  for  example,  hold  68%  of  positions  classified  as  Officials  and  Administrators  and 
51%  of  positions  classified  as  Professionals.    African-Americans  in  contrast  hold  77%  of  the 
Service/Maintenance positions. With respect to special appointments, 65% are White and 26% are 
African-American.   

Women are also under-represented in certain job categories. They are less likely than men to 
serve  as Protective Service Workers (11% of sworn officers and 39% of non-sworn officers), but 
are far more likely than men to serve in Administrative Support positions (87%).

American Museum Corp.

The  disparities  in  job  categories  contribute  to  differences  in  the  salaries  paid  to  men  and 
women  and  whites  and  minorities.    Male  employees  were  paid  an  average  of  $5,916  more  than 
female employees in fiscal 2018, while Whites were paid an average of $9,858 more than African-
Americans and only $353 more than other minorities (Exhibit 9).   

The salary gap between men and women of the same race however increased from 2013 to 
2018 for Whites and African-Americans. Salaries of white men exceeded those of white women by 
$5,597 in 2018, an increase over the $4,563 gap in 2013. The gap between African-American males 
and females rose from $1,389 in 2013 to $2,143 in 2018. The average salary for women trailed men 
by 10% in 2013 and 2018 (Exhibit 10). 

The  greatest  impediment  to  closing  the  salary  gap  for  African-Americans  is  their 
disproportionate  share  of  low  paying  jobs.    African-Americans  hold  more  than  half  of  positions 
classified as Grade 14 or below.  The grade with the largest number of African-American workers is 
Grade 13, which pays a maximum of $57,808. 

To  address  the  disparity  issues,  the  State  has  expanded  its  current  relationships  with 
Historically Black Colleges and Universities and professional organizations and its participation in 
job  fairs  that  may  be  sources  for  African-American,  Latino  and  other  diversity  recruitment. 
Launching  of  the  new  recruitment  module  of  the  Automated  Statewide  Personnel  System  has 
enhanced  the  ability  of  applicants  to  search  for  employment  opportunities  in  the  State.  The  State 
continues  to  use  the  Internet,  Facebook,  and  Twitter  to  share  job  announcements.    In  addition, 
partnerships  and  alliances  have  been  expanded  with  minority  and  disability  professional 
organizations  to  engage  their  membership,  increase  networking  opportunities  and  inform  them 
about  employment  opportunities  in  State  government.    The  State  has  also  added  a  diversity 
statement  to  the  State  job  application  to  affirm  its  commitment  to  equal  employment  opportunity 
and encourage diverse group members to apply for State positions.  

To  build  on  its  continuing  commitment  to  becoming  a  Model  Employer  of  People  with 
Disabilities, State government has taken a leading  role in  facilitating and advancing  opportunities 
for  Marylanders  with  disabilities  to  be  employed  by:    appointing  a  Statewide  Coordinator  for 
Employment  of  People  with  Disabilities;  expanding  the  Quest  Internship  Program  for  individuals 
with disabilities to include placing the names of individuals who complete the program on DBM’s 
Special  Options  Eligible  List  to  be  considered  for  permanent  positions  within  State  government; 
collaborating and partnering with other States to  identify best practices for employment of people 
with disabilities; and effective October 1, 2016, awarding job applicants with disabilities (as defined 
by the Americans with Disabilities Act) a five- point preference credit on selection test.  

As part of our proactive efforts, the State continues to update and expand its online learning 
management system, The HUB, which provides State employees the ability to browse and register 
for  training  on  various  professional  development  courses.  Courses  available  on  The  Hub  include 
training presentations on EEO, harassment and disability awareness in the workplace. In addition, 
the  State  continues  to  publish  policies  covering  sexual  harassment  prevention,  reasonable 
accommodations,  and non-discrimination  in  various formats, including print  and web-based.   The 
State  continues  to  train  managers  and  supervisors  to  recognize  and  avoid  unequal  treatment  of 
protected  group  members  and  to  enhance  their  skills  in  maintaining  equal  employment 
consideration in decisions regarding hiring, promotions, work assignments, employee development, 
training,  evaluations,  counseling,  and  discipline.    The  State’s  desire  is  to  maintain  a  work 

7 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
environment that attracts, engages, and retains a proficient and diverse workforce that can excel and 
meet the dynamic challenges of State government service. 

Other Data 

Other  data  included  in  the  report  focus  on  the  State’s  success  in  meeting  requests  for 
reasonable accommodations for workers with disabilities, trends in discrimination complaints, and 
employment at public higher education institutions.  Notable findings include: 

  511 reasonable accommodation requests were received from State employees and applicants 

for State employment in fiscal 2018.  89% of the requests were granted. 

  Complaints  of  discrimination  increased  slightly  from  595  in  fiscal  2017  to  600  in  fiscal 

2018. 

  The  majority  of  employees  at  the  University  System  of  Maryland  (56%)  and  St.  Mary’s 
College  of  Maryland  (82%)  were  white.    Approximately  51%  of  faculty  and  research 
positions in the System were filled by whites.  Females comprised 53.5% of the workforce; 
while males comprised 46.5% of the workforce. 

  African-Americans  composed  the  majority  of  workers  at  Morgan  State  University  (73%) 
and  Baltimore  City  Community  College  (72%).    Women  held  51%  of  the  positions  at 
Morgan State University and 60% of the positions at Baltimore City Community College.

INTRODUCTION 

       POLICY STATEMENT 

It is the policy of the State of Maryland to prohibit discrimination in any personnel  action

Maryland is committed to providing a work environment free from discrimination and protecting all 
State  employees  from  discrimination.  The  Equal  Employment  Opportunity  Program  ensures  that 
State government maintains a qualified diverse workforce and investigates and resolves allegations 
of discrimination and unlawful hiring practices in the work place. 

Recognizing  that  the  State’s  workforce  should  reflect  the  diversity  of  the  population  it

color,  creed,  genetic  information,  gender  identity  and  expression,  marital  status,  mental  or 
physical disability, national origin, race, religious affiliation, belief or opinion, sex, or sexual 
orientation.  

  Harassment of employees for any reason prohibited by law, including sexual harassment, is

employee violating State EEO policies. 

  Employees  will  not  be  subjected  to  any  form  of  retaliation  for  filing  a  complaint  of 
discrimination  or  harassment,  participating  in  an  investigation  of  a  complaint  of 
discrimination  or  harassment,  or  for  objecting  to  a  discriminatory  or  other  illegal  or 
inappropriate action or practice.

SECTION 5:  DISTRIBUTION OF STATE EMPLOYEE 
WORKFORCE BY SALARY AND GRADE AND  BY RACE 
AND GENDER 

INTRODUCTION 

Section five presents the salary and grade of employees by race and gender.  This section includes a 
comparison of salary and grade information for Fiscal Years 2013 through 2018.  

SUMMARY HIGHLIGHTS 

Trends displayed in the following charts include: 

  Male employees were paid an average of $5,916 more than female employees in fiscal 2018. 

  The salary gap between men and women of the same race increased from 2013 to 2018 for 

Whites and African-Americans. 

  The salary of white men exceeded the salary of white women by $4,563 in 2013 and $5,597 
in 2018.  The salary gap between African American males and females rose from $1,389 in 
2013 to $2,143 in 2018. 

  White employees were paid an average of $60,101 in fiscal 2018 compared to $51,243 for 

African-American employees, and $60,748 for other minority employees. 

  The  salary  differentials  between  men  and  women  and  Whites  and  African-Americans  are 
related to differences in the types of positions held.  Whites (79%) and men (61%) are far 
more  likely  than  African-Americans  (11%)  and  women  (39%)  to  hold  positions  in  the 
Executive Pay Plan with positions classified as Grade 24 and above.   African-Americans, in 
contrast,  hold  a  majority  of  the  positions  classified  at  Grade  14  or  below.    Females  hold 
approximately 61% of positions classified at Grade 14 and below.
