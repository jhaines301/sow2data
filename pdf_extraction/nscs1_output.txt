Acknowledgements

The authors first wish to thank the students who participated in our 2021 survey for continuing to 
enlighten us about their experiences in school, as well as the over 100,000 students who have participated 
in the National School Climate Surveys since it began in 1999. We also wish to acknowledge the 
organizations that helped disseminate information about the survey, including the LGBTQ+ youth  
services and programs that invited their constituents to participate in the survey, as well as the teachers 
and parents who encouraged their youth to participate. We are especially grateful to GLSEN’s Chapter 
volunteers and staff for spreading the word about the survey in their states and local communities. We are 
especially indebted to former GLSEN Research Institute staff Adrian Zongrone and Nhan Truong for their 
unbounded, diligent work in the earlier phases of the 2021 survey process as well as for their overall 
significant contributions to GLSEN’s research. We also would like to acknowledge GLSEN Research 
Institute 2021 Summer Research Fellow Jacquelyn Chin for their assistance in data collection. Given 
each installment of the National School Climate Survey builds on the work of past years, we would 
also like to acknowledge all the former GLSEN research staff who contributed to these reports: Emily 
Greytak, Elizabeth Diaz, Neal Palmer, Madelyn Boesen, Mark Bartkiewicz, Adrian Zongrone, Nhan Truong, 
Christian Villenas, David Danischewski, and Noreen Giga. We are also thankful for our GLSEN colleagues 
who provided thoughtful feedback and continual support throughout the survey development and data 
collection process.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

ABOUT THE SURVEY

In 1999, GLSEN identified that little was known about the school experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) youth and that LGBTQ+ youth were nearly absent from national studies 
of adolescents. We responded to this national need for data by launching the first National School Climate 
Survey, and we continue to meet this need for current data by conducting the study every two years. 
Since then, the biennial National School Climate Survey has documented the unique challenges LGBTQ+ 
students face and identified interventions that can improve school climate. The study documents the 
prevalence of indicators of a hostile school climate for LGBTQ+ students, and explores the effects that a 
hostile school climate may have on LGBTQ+ students’ educational outcomes and well-being. The study 
also examines the availability and the utility of LGBTQ+-related school resources and supports that may 
offset the negative effects of a hostile school climate and promote a positive learning experience. Across 
the years, the survey has been slightly modified with each installment to reflect new or emerging concerns 
about school climate for LGBTQ+ students, but its content has remained largely the same since 2001. 
However, the data used for this current report is from the 2020–2021 academic year, when schools had 
to respond to the COVID pandemic. Because of that, we had to adapt and modify some survey questions 
accordingly to changes in school structures and instructional methods. While the report includes findings 
about LGBTQ+ students’ experiences in schools overall, we also discuss key findings about the differences 
between the experiences of students in online only, in-person only, and hybrid learning environments 
throughout the report. The National School Climate Survey remains one of the few studies to examine 
the school experiences of LGBTQ+ students nationally, and its results have been vital to GLSEN’s 
understanding of the issues that LGBTQ+ students face, thereby informing our ongoing work to ensure safe 
and affirming schools for all.

In our 2021 report, we examine the experiences of LGBTQ+ students with regard to indicators of negative 
school climate:

• Hearing biased remarks, including homophobic remarks, in school;

• Feeling unsafe in school because of personal characteristics, such as sexual orientation, gender 

expression, gender, or race/ethnicity;

• Missing classes or days of school because of safety reasons;

• Experiencing harassment and assault in school and online; and

• Experiencing discriminatory policies and practices at school.

In addition, we examine whether students report these experiences to school officials or their families, and 
how these adults addressed the problem. Further, we examine the impact of a hostile school climate on 
LGBTQ+ students’ academic achievement, educational aspirations, and psychological well-being. We also 
examine how the school experiences of LGBTQ+ students vary by personal and community characteristics.

We also demonstrate the degree to which LGBTQ+ students have access to supportive resources in school, 
and we explore the possible benefits of these resources:

• GSAs (Gay-Straight Alliances or Gender and Sexuality Alliances) or similar clubs;

• Supportive and inclusive school policies, such as anti-bullying/harassment policies and transgender 

and nonbinary student policies;

• Supportive school staff; and

• Curricular resources that are inclusive of LGBTQ+-related topics.

Given that GLSEN has been conducting the survey for two decades, we also examine changes over time on 
indicators of negative school climate and levels of access to LGBTQ+-related resources in schools.

METHODS

The 2021 National School Climate Survey was conducted online from April through August 2021. To 
obtain a representative national sample of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) 
youth, we conducted outreach through national, regional, and local organizations that provide services 
to or advocate on behalf of LGBTQ+ youth, and advertised and promoted on social media sites, such 
as Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat. To ensure representation of transgender youth, youth of color, 
and youth in rural communities, we made special efforts to notify groups and organizations that work 
predominantly with these populations.

The final sample consisted of a total of 22,298 students between the ages of 13 and 21. Students came 
from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana 
Islands. Just over two-thirds of the sample (67.2%) was White, 33.8% identified as cisgender and 31.5% 
as nonbinary, and 30.1% identified as bisexual and 28.8% as gay or lesbian. The average age of students 
in the sample was 15.4 years and they were in grades 6 to 12, with the largest numbers in grades 9, 10 
and 11.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

Hostile School Climate

Schools nationwide are hostile environments for a distressing number of LGBTQ+ students, the overwhelming 
majority of whom routinely hear anti-LGBTQ+ language and experience victimization and discrimination at 
school. As a result, many LGBTQ+ students avoid school activities or miss school entirely.

School Safety

• 81.8% of LGBTQ+ students in our survey reported feeling unsafe in school because of at least one of 

their actual or perceived personal characteristics. 

• 68.0% of LGBTQ+ students felt unsafe at school because of their SOGIE (sexual orientation, gender 

identity and/or gender expression) characteristics — 50.6% because of their sexual orientation, 43.2% 
because of their gender expression, and 40.3% because of their gender.

• Overall, LGBTQ+ students in online-only learning environments were least likely to feel unsafe at school 

due to a personal characteristic and those in in-person only learning environments were most likely.

• LGBTQ+ students most commonly avoided school bathrooms, locker rooms, and physical education 

or gym classes, with approximately 4 in 10 students avoiding each of these spaces because they felt 
unsafe or uncomfortable (45.1%, 42.6%, and 39.4% respectively).

• Most reported avoiding school functions or extracurricular activities (78.8%) because they felt unsafe 

or uncomfortable.

• LGBTQ+ students who had been only in in-person learning environments did not differ from those who 

had been in hybrid learning environments with regard to avoiding spaces at school.

• 32.2% of LGBTQ+ students missed at least one entire day of school in the past month because they 

felt unsafe or uncomfortable, 11.3% missed four or more days in the past month.

xv

• Nearly a fifth of LGBTQ+ students (16.2%) reported having ever changed schools due to feeling unsafe 

or uncomfortable at school.

Anti-LGBTQ+ Remarks at School

• Nearly all LGBTQ+ students (97.0%) heard “gay” used in a negative way (e.g., “that’s so gay”) at 

school; 68.0% heard these remarks frequently or often, and 93.7% reported that they felt distressed 
because of this language.

• 95.1% of LGBTQ+ students heard the phrase “no homo” at school, and 63.3% heard this phrase 

frequently or often.

44.2% heard this type of language frequently or often.

• 91.8% of LGBTQ+ students heard negative remarks about gender expression (not acting “masculine 

enough” or “feminine enough”); 56.2% heard these remarks frequently or often.

72.0% of students reported hearing negative remarks about gender expression from teachers or other 
school staff.

• Overall, students who attended school only in-person heard anti-LGBTQ+ remarks more frequently than 

did students who attended school only online or in a hybrid setting

• Only one-tenth of LGBTQ+ students (10.9%) reported that school staff intervened most of the time or 
always when overhearing homophobic remarks at school, and less than one-tenth of LGBTQ+ students 
(8.8%) reported that school staff intervened most of the time or always when overhearing negative 
remarks about gender expression.

• LGBTQ+ students who were in in-person only learning environments reported the lowest levels of staff 

intervention on anti-LGBTQ+ remarks.

Harassment and Assault at School

The vast majority of LGBTQ+ students who attended school in-person at some point during the 
2021–2022 academic year (83.1%) experienced in-person harassment or assault based on personal 
characteristics, including sexual orientation, gender expression, gender, religion, actual or perceived  
race/ethnicity, and actual or perceived disability. Among LGBTQ+ students who were in in-person only  
or hybrid learning environments:

• 76.1% experienced in-person verbal harassment (e.g., called names or threatened) specifically based 

on sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender at some point in the past year — 60.7% of 
LGBTQ+ students were verbally harassed based on their sexual orientation, 57.4% based on gender 
expression, and 51.3% based on gender.

• 31.2% were physically harassed (e.g., pushed or shoved) in the past year based on based on their 
sexual orientation, gender expression, or gender — 22.4% of LGBTQ+ students were physically

xvi

• 12.5% were physically assaulted (e.g., punched, kicked, injured with a weapon) in the past year based

based on actual or perceived race/ethnicity.

• 53.7% of LGBTQ+ students were sexually harassed (e.g., unwanted touching or sexual remarks) in the 

past year at school.

LGBTQ+ students who attended school online at some point during the 2020–2021 academic year were 
asked about their experiences with online harassment based on personal characteristics during the school 
day by students from their school. Among those who attended school online at some point during the 
2021–2022 academic year:

• 36.6% were harassed online based on their sexual orientation;

• 31.8% were harassed online based on their gender expression; and

• 30.3% were harassed online based on their gender.

Students who were in online only learning environments experienced higher rates of online harassment 
based on sexual orientation, gender, and gender expression than those who were in hybrid learning 
environments.

Additionally, many LGBTQ+ students reported online harassment based on other characteristics:

• 17.3% reported being harassed online based on their actual or perceived disability, 

• 13.7% reported being harassed online based on their religion; and

Student Reporting of Harassment and Assault Incidents

• 61.5% of LGBTQ+ students who were harassed or assaulted in school did not report the incident to 

school staff, most commonly (69.6% of students experiencing harassment or assault) because they did 
not think school staff would do anything about the harassment even if they did report it.

• Students in in-person learning environments reported harassment to school staff at higher rates than 
did students in online only or hybrid settings; half of students (49.5%) who attended school online 
(both online only and hybrid), stated that they did not report victimization online and instead only 
reported these experiences to staff when they attended school in person.

• 60.3% of the students who did report an incident said that school staff did nothing in response or told 

the student to ignore it.

• Staff responses to reports of harassment and assault were similar across all three types of learning 

environments.

Discriminatory School Policies and Practices

Most LGBTQ+ students (58.9%) had experienced LGBTQ+-related discriminatory policies or practices at 
school. Some of the most common discriminatory policies and practices experienced by LGBTQ+ students 
were those that targeted students’ gender, potentially limiting their ability to make gender-affirming 
choices and negatively impacting their school experience:

• 29.2% had been prevented from using their chosen name or pronouns in their schools;

• 27.2% had been prevented from using the bathroom that aligned with their gender;

• 23.8% had been prevented from using the locker room that aligned with their gender; 

• 20.6% had been prevented from wearing clothes deemed “inappropriate” based on gender; and

• 16.0% had been prevented from playing on the sports team that is consistent with their gender.

Many LGBTQ+ students also experienced other forms of discrimination:

• 25.2% of LGBTQ+ students were disciplined for public affection, such as kissing or holding hands, 

that is not similarly disciplined among non-LGBTQ+ students;

• 16.6% of LGBTQ+ students were prevented from writing or talking about LGBTQ+ issues in 

extracurricular activities;

• 15.6% of LGBTQ+ students were prevented from writing about or doing school projects about  

LGBTQ+ issues; 

• 12.3% of LGBTQ+ students were prevented from wearing clothing supporting LGBTQ+ issues;

• 12.3% of LGBTQ+ were prevented from forming or promoting a GSA; and

• 11.3% of LGBTQ+ students shared that school staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged them 

from playing sports because they identified as LGBTQ+.

LGBTQ+ students who had only been in in-person learning environments during the academic year were 
far more likely to experience any form of LGBTQ+-related discrimination than those in the other types of 
learning environments.

Effects of a Hostile School Climate

A hostile school climate affects students’ academic success and mental health. LGBTQ+ students who 
experience victimization and discrimination at school have worse educational outcomes and poorer 
psychological well-being.

Effects of Victimization

LGBTQ+ students who experienced higher levels of in-person victimization because of their sexual 
orientation:

• Were nearly three times as likely to have missed school in the past month than those who experienced 

lower levels (60.7% vs. 23.3%);

• Felt lower levels of belonging to their school community, performed poorer academically, (2.83 vs. 

xviii

3.15 average GPA), and were nearly twice as likely to report that they did not plan to pursue any  
post-secondary education (e.g., college or trade school) than those who experienced lower levels 
(16.6% vs. 9.4%);

• Were nearly twice as likely to have been disciplined at school than those who experienced lower levels 

of victimization (61.1% vs. 33.6%); and

• Had lower self-esteem and higher levels of depression than those who experienced lower levels of 

victimization.

LGBTQ+ students who experienced higher levels of in-person victimization because of their gender 
expression:

• Were almost three times as likely to have missed school in the past month than those who experienced 

lower levels (60.7% vs. 23.6%);

• Felt lower levels of belonging to their school community, performed poorer academically, (2.76 vs. 
3.17 average GPA), and were twice as likely to report that they did not plan to pursue any post-
secondary education (e.g., college or trade school; 18.3% vs. 8.8%) than those who experienced lower 
levels of victimization;

• Were more likely to have been disciplined at school than those who experienced lower levels of 

victimization (59.8 % vs. 34.7%), and

• Had lower self-esteem and higher levels of depression than those who experiences lower levels of 

victimization.

LGBTQ+ students who experienced higher levels of in-person victimization because of their gender:

• Were almost three times as likely to have missed school in the past month than those who experienced 

lower levels (60.3% vs. 24.4%);

• Felt lower levels of belonging to their school community, performed poorer academically (2.76 vs. 3.17 
average GPA), and were twice as likely to report that they did not plan to pursue any post-secondary 
education (e.g., college or trade school; 18.1% vs. 9.0%) than those who experienced lower levels of 
victimization;

• Were more likely to have been disciplined at school than those who experienced lower levels of 

victimization (60.9% vs. 33.9%); and

• Had lower self-esteem and higher levels of depression than those who experienced lower levels of 

victimization.

Of the LGBTQ+ students who indicated that they were considering dropping out of school, half (51.5%) 
indicated that they were doing so because of a hostile school climate, including issues with harassment, 
unsupportive peers or educators, and gendered school policies/practices. 

Effects of Discrimination 

LGBTQ+ students who experienced LGBTQ+-related discrimination at school were:

• Nearly three times as likely to have missed school in the past month as those who had not (43.3% vs. 

16.4%);

xix

• Had lower GPAs than their peers who experienced no anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination (2.92 vs. 3.20); 

• Were more likely to have been disciplined at school (51.2% vs. 26.2%); and

• Had lower self-esteem and school belonging and higher levels of depression.

Of the LGBTQ+ students who indicated that they were considering dropping out of school, a sizable 
percentage (31.4%) indicated that they were doing so because of the hostile climate created by gendered 
school policies and practices.

LGBTQ+-Related School Resources and Supports

Students who feel safe and supported at school have better educational outcomes. LGBTQ+ students 
who have LGBTQ+-related school resources report better school experiences and academic success. 
Unfortunately, all too many schools fail to provide these critical resources.

GSAs (Gay-Straight Alliances/Gender and Sexuality Alliances)

Availability and Participation

• Only a third of LGBTQ+ students (34.8%) said that their school had an active GSA or similar student 

club in the 2020–2021 academic year.

• LGBTQ+ students in in-school only learning environments were less likely to have a GSA available than 

those in online only or hybrid learning environments (26.5% vs. 36.8% and 35.6%, respectively).

• About half (47.8%) of LGBTQ+ students with a GSA at school reported having participated in the club.

Utility

Compared to LGBTQ+ students who did not have a GSA in their school, students who had an active GSA  
in their school:

• Were less likely to hear homophobic remarks at school — using “gay ” in a negative way (56.6% 

compared to 74.3% reporting often or frequently), “no homo” (56.6% vs. 67.0% reporting often or 
frequently), and other homophobic remarks such as “fag” or “dyke” (34.0% vs. 49.8%) often  
or frequently;

• Were less likely to hear negative remarks often or frequently about gender expression (48.9% vs. 

60.3%);

• Were less likely to hear negative remarks often or frequently about transgender people (30.5% vs. 

44.4%);

• Were more likely to report that school personnel intervened when hearing homophobic remarks  

(16.0% vs. 10.2% reporting staff intervene most of the time or always) and negative remarks about 
gender expression ( 11.5% vs. 7.1% reporting staff intervened most of the time or always);

• Were less likely to feel unsafe regarding their sexual orientation (41.1% vs. 55.8%), gender  

expression (36.6% vs. 46.9%) and gender (35.5% vs 43.0%); 

• Experienced lower levels of in-person victimization related to their sexual orientation (17.7% vs 

33.0%), gender expression (18.2% vs 31.9%) and gender (17.7% vs 30.2%);

xx

• Were more likely to report having many supportive school staff (67.9% vs 46.6%) and more accepting 

peers (55.4% vs 32.4%);

• Were less likely to have missed school in the past month because of feeling unsafe or uncomfortable 

(24.4% vs. 36.3%);

• Felt greater belonging to their school community, performed better academically in school and were 

more likely to plan on pursuing post-secondary education; and

• Reported better psychological well-being than students in schools without GSAs: higher levels of self-

esteem, lower levels of depression, and a lower likelihood of having seriously considered suicide in the 
past year.

Inclusive Curricular Resources

Availability

• A majority (71.6%) of LGBTQ+ students reported that their classes did not include any LGBTQ+ topics 

in class.

LGBTQ+ topics had been discussed in a positive way than were students who attended school only  
in-person.

• Only 7.4% received LGBTQ+ sex education, which included positive representations of both LGB and 

transgender and nonbinary topics.

• Students who attended school online, either in online only or hybrid learning environments, were more 
likely to report receiving any kind of sex education, and LGBTQ+ inclusive sex education than were 
students who attended school only in person.

assigned reading than students who attended hybrid or online-only school.

• Under half of students (42.8%) reported that they could find information about LGBTQ+-related issues 

in their school library.

• Just under half of students (48.2%) with internet access at school reported being able to access 

LGBTQ+-related information online via school computers.

Utility

Compared to students in school without an LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum, LGBTQ+ students in schools 
with an LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum:

• Were less likely to hear homophobic remarks — “gay” used in a negative way (48.7% compared to 

72.0% reporting often or frequently), “no homo” (51.2% vs. 65.7% reporting often or frequently), and 
other homophobic remarks such as “fag” or “dyke” (26.7% vs. 47.8% reporting often or frequently);

xxi

• Were less likely to hear negative remarks about gender expression often or frequently (42.8% vs. 

58.9%);

vs. 67.1%);

• Felt greater belonging to their school community, performed better academically in school and were 

more likely to plan on pursuing post-secondary education;

• Were more likely to report that their classmates were somewhat or very accepting of LGBTQ+ people 

(66.9% vs. 35.3%); and

• Reported better psychological well-being: higher levels of self-esteem, lower levels of depression, and a

Availability

• Almost all LGBTQ+ students (96.3%) could identify at least one staff member supportive of LGBTQ+ 

students at their school.

• More than half of students (58.2%) could identify at least six supportive school staff, but fewer 

(34.7%) of students could identify 11 or more supportive staff.

• Those students who were in online learning environments for the entire school year reported a higher 
number of supportive educators than those in hybrid online and in-person learning environments and 
those who were only in in-person learning environments.

• Less than a quarter (23.7%) reported that their school administration was somewhat or very supportive 

of LGBTQ+ students.

• LGBTQ+ students who were in in-person only learning environments were less likely to report that their

safe at school because of their presence, and a smaller percentage (25.1%) felt unsafe because of 
their presence.

• About half (51.9%) had seen at least one Safe Space sticker or poster at their school (these stickers or 

posters often serve to identify supportive educators).

• LGBTQ+ students who were in hybrid learning environments (both online and in-person) were most 
likely and students in online-only learning environments were least likely to Safe Space stickers or 
posters at school.

xxii

Utility

Compared to LGBTQ+ students with few supportive school staff or none (0 to 5), students with many (11 
or more) supportive staff at their school:

• Were less likely to feel unsafe because of their sexual orientation (34.7% vs. 64.2%), gender 

expression (32.6% vs. 51.7%) and gender (30.1% vs 48.3%);

• Were less likely to miss school because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable (20.1% vs. 42.4%);

• Felt greater belonging to their school community, performed better academically in school and were 

more likely to plan on pursuing post-secondary education; and 

• Reported better psychological well-being, higher levels of self-esteem, lower levels of depression, and 

lower likelihood of having seriously considered suicide in the past year.

Students who had seen a Safe Space sticker or poster in their school were more likely to identify a high 
number of supportive staff (11 or more) in their schools, compared to students who had not seen a Safe 
Space sticker or poster at school (50.1% vs 17.8%). 

Inclusive and Supportive School Policies

Availability

• Although a majority (76.1%) of students had an anti-bullying policy at their school, only 12.0% of 

students reported that their school had a comprehensive policy (i.e., one that specifically enumerates 
both sexual orientation and gender identity/expression).

• LGBTQ+ students who had been in in-person instruction during the entire academic year were, in 

fact, less likely to report having a comprehensive policy, and more likely to have a generic policy, than 
students who had been only in online instruction, even after accounting for school characteristics.

• Only 8.2% of LGBTQ+ students reported that their school or district had official policies or guidelines 

to support transgender or nonbinary students.

• Those students who were in in-person only learning environments were less likely to report having an 

affirming policy or guidelines for transgender and nonbinary students than students who were in online 
only and hybrid learning environments, even after considering school characteristics.

Utility

LGBTQ+ students in schools with a comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment policy:

• Were less likely to hear “gay” used in a negative way often or frequently (53.9% compared to 69.8% 

of students with a generic policy and 72.0% of students with no policy);

• Were less likely to hear the phrase “no homo” often or frequently (54.7% compared to 64.9% of 

students with a generic policy and 63.9% of students with no policy);

compared to 56.9% of students with a generic policy and 59.4% of students with no policy);

xxiii

• Were less likely to hear negative remarks about transgender people often or frequently (30.6% 
compared to 39.9% of students with a generic policy and 43.4% of students with no policy);  

• Were more likely to report that staff intervene when hearing anti-LGBTQ+ remarks (24.5% compared 

to 11.6% of students with a generic policy and 7.2% of students with no policy);

• Experienced less anti-LGBTQ+ victimization; and

• Were more likely to report victimization incidents to school staff and were more likely to rate school 

staff’s response to such incidents as effective.

Among transgender and nonbinary students, those in schools with a transgender/nonbinary student policy 
or guidelines:

• Were less likely to experience anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination in their school than their transgender and 

nonbinary peers. Specifically, they were:

 - Less likely to be prevented from using their name or pronoun of choice in school (19.4% vs. 

54.2%);

 - Less likely to be prevented from using bathrooms aligned with their gender (25.6% vs. 59.3%);

 - Less likely to be prevented from using locker rooms aligned with their gender (29.0% vs.  

59.0%); and

 - Less likely to be prevented from wearing clothes thought to be “inappropriate” based on gender 

(8.8% vs. 31.9%);

school in the past month for safety reasons); and

• Were more likely to feel a part of their school community (69.2% vs. 42.0% reported higher levels of 

school belonging).

Changes in School Climate for LGBTQ+ Students Over Time

Although school climate for LGBTQ+ students has improved, overall, since our first installment of this 
survey in 1999, school remains quite hostile for many LGBTQ+ students. In 2021, we saw few positive 
changes from the results of the 2019 installment of this survey.

Changes in Indicators of Hostile School Climate

Anti-LGBTQ+ Remarks

• Homophobic remarks had been on the decline from 2001 to 2015, and remained consistent from 
2015 to 2017, However, in 2019, the frequency of remarks declined and remained static in 2021.

• Use of expressions such as “that’s so gay” has remained the most common form of biased language 
heard by LGBTQ+ students in school. These remarks had been in consistent decline until 2015, but 
increased from 2015 to 2019 and remained at a similar level in 2021.

xxiv

• Hearing the expression “no homo” had consistently been less common than most other types of 

LGBTQ+-related biased remarks, and the frequency had been on a decline from 2011 to 2017. In 
2019, we saw a sizeable increase from 2017, and remained at a similar level in 2021.

• Hearing negative remarks about gender expression had not changed in the early years of the survey, 

but decreased from 2011 to 2013. These remarks increased in 2015 but declined in 2017 and again 
in 2019. In 2021, the frequency of remarks was higher than in 2019, but lower than all years prior.

• Negative remarks about transgender people had steadily increased from 2013, when we first asked this 

question, to 2017, but decreased in 2019 and remained at a similar level in 2021.

• Hearing homophobic remarks and negative remarks about gender expression from teachers or schools 

staff increased from 2019 to 2021 and were significantly higher than most recent years. 

Harassment and Assault

• With regard to victimization based on sexual orientation:

 - After years of decline, the frequency of verbal harassment has not changed from 2015 to 2021; 

 - Since 2007, the frequency of physical harassment has generally been in decline. Although there 

was no change from 2019 to 20201, but both years were lower than all years prior to 2017.

 - Physical assault changed little between 2001 and 2007, but generally has declined from 2011  

to 2021. 

• With regard to victimization related to gender expression:

 - Verbal harassment did not change between 2001 and 2007, and generally decreased from 2009 

to 2019 and did not change in 2021, but 2019 and 2021 were lower than most prior years;

 - Physical harassment has not changed from 2017 to 2021, but was lower in these years than  

prior years.

 - Physical assault continued a pattern of modest decline, and was lower in 2021 than all  

previous years.

• The rates of victimization related to gender (verbal harassment, physical harassment and physical 
assault) had not changed in 2021 from 2019, but were all lower than early years of the survey.

• There have been no changes in the frequency of LGBTQ+ students reporting victimization to school 

staff from 2017 to 2021, and LGBTQ+ students’ ratings of the effectiveness of staff intervention when 
incidents had been reported have remained similar from 2013 to 2017.

Changes in Experiences of Discrimination

Overall, over half of LGBTQ+ students experienced some type of LGBTQ+-related discrimination at school 
at all five time points. In 2019, we saw the percentage of LGBTQ+ students who experienced any form of 
anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination at school decline from the previous year; however, the percentage increased in 
2021 where it did not differ from the years 2013 to 2017.

With regard to the specific forms of discrimination, the percentages for most forms were highest in 2013. 
In 2019, we had seen a decline in most forms of discrimination from prior years. In 2021, however, many 
of these forms of discrimination increased, specifically, restrictions on the use of names and pronouns, 

xxv

clothing based on gender, clothing supporting LGBTQ+ issue, and school dances, as well as generally 
being disciplined for identifying as LGBTQ+.

Changes in Availability of LGBTQ+-Related School Resources and Supports

Supportive Student Clubs (GSAs)

• In 2021, the percentage of LGBTQ+ students who had a GSA available at their school dropped 

significantly. Whereas more than half of LGBTQ+ students had reported having a GSA at school in 
recent years, less than 40% reported having an active GSA at their school in 2021. 

• About half of LGBTQ+ students with a GSA at school participated in the club (47.8%).

Curricular Resources

Overall, there has been few positive changes in LGBTQ+-related curricular resources 

• Access to LGBTQ+-related internet resources through their school computers was highest in 2019 but 

decreased in 2021.

• Access to LGBTQ+-related books and resources in school libraries was highest in 2019 but decreased 
in 2021. Overall, there have been few changes across the years in the availability of school library 
resources.

• Being taught positive LGBTQ+ material in class has been one of the least common curricular supports, 

has changed little across prior survey years, and was even lower in 2021 than in 2019.

• The availability of LGBTQ+ information in textbooks and class resources has also historically been 

one of the least commonly reported curricular supports for LGBTQ+ students, and was not different in 
2021 than 2019.

Supportive Educators

• Since 2011, more than 95% of LGBTQ+ students reported having at least one supportive school 

personnel at school.

• In 2021, however, the number of supportive school personnel was lower than in recent years, 

specifically 2013 to 2019. Nevertheless, the number of supportive school personnel in 2021 was 
higher than early years of the survey, specifically 2009 and earlier.

Anti-Bullying/Harassment Policies

• Overall, there was a sharp increase in the number of students reporting any type of policy after 2009, 

and the rate has remained more or less consistent since 2011. From 2011 to 2015, there had 
generally been small increases with regard to any type of anti-bullying/harassment policy, followed by 
a small decline from 2015 to 2017. In 2021, the rate had not changed from 2019 but was somewhat 
lower than 2017.

• With regard to enumerated policies, there was little change from 2005 to 2013. However, from 2015 
to 2019, we saw a pattern of small increases in the percentages of LGBTQ+ students who reported 
having comprehensive policies (i.e., fully enumerated), and small decreases in those who reported 
partially enumerated policies. However, in 2021, the percentage of LGBTQ+ students reporting 
comprehensive policies was lower than in 2019 and the percentage reporting partially enumerated 
policies had not changed.

Differences in LGBTQ+ Students’ School Experiences by Personal Demographics

LGBTQ+ students are a diverse population, and although they share many similar experiences, their 
experiences in school often vary based on their personal demographics. We examined differences in 
LGBTQ+ student experiences, based on: 1) sexual orientation, including differences between gay and 
lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, queer, asexual and questioning students; 2) gender identity, including 
differences between and among transgender, nonbinary, cisgender, and questioning students; and 3) racial/
ethnic identity, including differences between Arab American/Middle Eastern/North African (MENA), Asian 
American/Pacific Islander/Native Hawaiian (AAPI), Black, Latinx, Native American/American Indian/Alaska 
Native (referred to as “Native and Indigenous”), multiracial, and White LGBTQ+ students.

Sexual Orientation

• Overall, pansexual students reported the most negative school experiences in comparison to students 

of other sexual orientations. Pansexual students experienced higher levels of sexual harassment, 
victimization based on sexual orientation, victimization based on gender identity, and victimization 
based on gender, than students of many other sexual orientations. They also experienced more 
discriminatory policies and practices, missed more school due to feeling unsafe, changed schools more 
often and had lower educational aspirations than LGBTQ+ peers of many other sexual orientations.

• Compared to students of other sexual orientations, queer or gay and lesbian students were more likely 

to be “out” about their sexual orientation at school — both to other students and to school staff.

Gender

• Transgender students, in general, experienced the most hostile school climates compared to their 

peers. Among transgender students, transgender boys and students who identified as only transgender 
reported somewhat more negative school experiences than transgender nonbinary students and 
transgender girls.

• Nonbinary students who did not also identify as transgender had somewhat better school experiences 
than transgender-identified students. Among nonbinary students, those who identified as nonbinary 
male or nonbinary female experienced less hostile school climates than those who identified only as 
nonbinary or genderqueer and those with other nonbinary identities (e.g., agender, demigender).

• Among cisgender LGBQ students, male students experienced a more hostile school climate based on 
their gender expression and on sexual orientation than cisgender female students, whereas cisgender 
female students experienced a more hostile school climate based on their gender than cisgender male 
students.

• Questioning students differed quite significantly from cisgender students, as they reported significantly 

worse school experiences.

Race and Ethnicity

Overall, we found that Native and Indigenous LGBTQ+ students experienced more hostile school 
climates than their peers of other racial/ethnic groups. Native and Indigenous students were more likely 
to experience higher rates of victimization based on sexual orientation, gender expression, gender, and 
race/ethnicity than almost all other races/ethnicities. Additionally, they were more likely to report poorer 
outcomes when considering their feelings about education as they reported the lowest levels of school 
belonging compared to students of all other races/ethnicities.

• Black students were more likely than most other students to feel unsafe due to their race/ethnicity, 

except for AAPI and Native and Indigenous students. 

xxvii

• Over half of all LGBTQ+ students of color experienced in-person victimization based on race/ethnicity.

• More than a quarter of all LGBTQ+ students of color experienced online victimization based on race/

ethnicity in their online classrooms.

• White students were less likely than all other racial/ethnic groups to feel unsafe or experience 

victimization because of their racial/ethnic identity.

Among the LGBTQ+ students in most racial/ethnic groups, the majority had experienced some form of 
anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination at school, and the percentages were similar across most of the racial/ethnic 
groups. Although AAPI students were the least likely to report experiencing anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, 
when compared to students of all other races/ethnicities, and Native and Indigenous and Latinx students 
were more likely than Black students to report experiencing anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination.

Differences in LGBTQ+ Students’ School Experiences by School Characteristics

LGBTQ+ students are a diverse population, and although they share many similar experiences, their 
experiences in school often vary based on the type and location of the schools they attend.

School Level

• LGBTQ+ students in middle school had more hostile school experiences than LGBTQ+ students in 

high school, including experiencing higher rates of biased language, victimization, and anti-LGBTQ+ 
discriminatory school policies and practices.

• LGBTQ+ middle school students were less likely than high school students to have access to LGBTQ+-
related school resources, including GSAs, supportive school personnel, LGBTQ+-inclusive curricular 
resources, and inclusive policies.

School Type

• Overall, LGBTQ+ students in private non-religious schools had fewer hostile school experiences than 

those in public schools and those in religious schools.

• LGBTQ+ public school students were most likely to hear homophobic remarks at school and 

experienced the greatest levels of gender-based victimization, whereas those in religious schools were 
most likely to hear negative remarks about gender expression.

• LGBTQ+ students in public schools generally experienced higher levels of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization 

than others.

• Students in religious schools were the most likely to report experiencing anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory 

school policies and practices.

• Overall, students in religious schools were less likely to report having LGBTQ+-related resources and 
supports in their schools, and students in private schools were more likely to report having these 
resources and supports. Additionally, students in charter schools in general had greater access to 
resources and supports than those in regular public schools.

School Locale

• LGBTQ+ students in rural schools faced more hostile school climates than students in urban and 
suburban schools including experiencing higher rates of biased language, victimization, and anti-
LGBTQ+ discriminatory school policies and practices.

xxviii

• LGBTQ+ students in suburban schools experienced lower levels of both in-person and online anti-

LGBTQ+ victimization than all others.

• LGBTQ+ students in rural/small town schools were least likely to have LGBTQ+-related school 

resources or supports, as compared to students in urban and suburban schools.

Region

• LGBTQ+ students in the South had more negative school experiences overall than students in all other 

regions, including higher rates of biased language, victimization, and anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory 
school policies and practices, and LGBTQ+ students in the Midwest had more negative experiences 
overall than those in the Northeast and West.

• Overall, LGBTQ+ students in the South were least likely to have access to LGBTQ+-related resources at 
school, whereas students in the Northeast were most likely to have LGBTQ+-related school resources.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

It is clear that there is an urgent need for action to create safe and affirming learning environments for 
LGBTQ+ students. Results from the 2021 National School Climate Survey demonstrate the ways in which 
school-based supports — such as supportive staff, inclusive and supportive school policies, curricular 
resources inclusive of LGBTQ+ people, and GSAs — can positively affect LGBTQ+ students’ school 
experiences. Yet findings on school climate over time suggest that more efforts are needed to reduce 
harassment and discrimination and increase affirmative supports. Based on these findings, we recommend:

• Increasing student access to appropriate and accurate information regarding LGBTQ+ people, history, 

and events through inclusive curricula, and library and internet resources;

• Supporting student clubs, such as GSAs, that provide support for LGBTQ+ students and address 

LGBTQ+ issues in education;

• Providing professional development for school staff to improve rates of intervention and increase the 

number of supportive teachers and other staff available to students; 

• Ensuring that school policies and practices, such as those related to dress codes and school dances, 

do not discriminate against LGBTQ+ students; 

• Enacting school policies that provide transgender and gender nonconforming students equal access to 
school facilities and activities and specify appropriate educational practices to support these students; 
and 

• Adopting and implementing comprehensive bullying/harassment policies that specifically enumerate 

sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression in individual schools and districts, with clear 
and effective systems for reporting and addressing incidents that students experience.

Instituting these measures can move us toward a future in which all students have the opportunity to learn 
and succeed in school, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. Especially 
given the decline in LGBTQ+ supports in schools that we found in this year’s report, it is imperative that all 
who are committed to ensuring safe and affirming schools for all students intensify their efforts in policy, 
advocacy, and classroom practices.

INTRODUCTION

For more than 30 years, GLSEN has worked 
to ensure that schools are safe and affirming 
spaces for all students, regardless of their sexual 
orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. 
As part of this mission, the GLSEN Research 
Institute conducts research on sexual orientation, 
gender identity, and gender identity issues in K–12 
education to raise awareness among policymakers, 
educators, advocates, and the general public. 
In 1999, GLSEN began conducting the GLSEN 
National School Climate Survey (NSCS), a national 
biennial survey of secondary school students 
who identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or 
transgender, and as identities change over time, 
later surveys included those who identify as other 
non-cisgender and non-heterosexual identities, 
including pansexual, queer, transgender, nonbinary, 
genderqueer, and two-spirit (All aforementioned 
identities are referred to as “LGBTQ+” in this 
report.) The NSCS explores the experiences of U.S. 
LGBTQ+ middle and high school students, reports 
on the prevalence of anti-LGBTQ+ language, 
discrimination, and victimization, and documents 
the impact that these experiences have on LGBTQ+ 
students’ educational outcomes and well-being. 
The NSCS also examines the availability of 
school resources and supports, including GSAs 
(Gender and Sexuality Alliances or Gay-Straight 
Alliances) and similar supportive student clubs, 
LGBTQ+-inclusive curricular resources, supportive 
educators, and inclusive and supportive school 
district policies, and their utility for creating safer 
and more affirming learning environments for 
LGBTQ+ students.

The 2020–2021 school year started with a 
presidential administration in place whose policies 
and practices were often hostile to LGBTQ+ 
students, and since our last 2019 report, the 
Trump administration continued to message to 
LGBTQ+ students that they were not supportive of 
them through these policies and actions. Between 
2019 and 2020, this administration’s actions 
were particularly hostile to transgender students, 
especially transgender athletes. They took many 
approaches to prohibit transgender youth from 
being able to participate in sports, including filing 
a statement of interest in the U.S. District Court 
for the District of Connecticut stating their belief 
that Title IX protections exclude transgender 
female athletes,1 and further, that athletics policies 
that are supportive of transgender girls violate 
Title IX,2 threatening to withhold federal funding 
from states that allow transgender athletes to 

participate in sports that align with their gender 
identity,3 and publicly supporting states’ legislations 
banning transgender athletes from participating 
in sports.4 Regarding LGBTQ+ youth in general, 
in 2019 the Department of Education removed 
sexual orientation and gender identity in their 
tracking of bullying, preventing the collection of 
any data by the department on LGBTQ+-related 
bullying. Other policies and actions targeted 
LGBTQ+ educators, and their rights in schools.5 In 
2019, the administration stated their belief that 
religious schools should be able to discriminate 
against LGBTQ+ educators and also to remove 
LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum and materials from 
classrooms.6 Although the Supreme Court’s decision 
on Bostock v. Clayton County in 2020 stated that 
LGBTQ+ people, including LGBTQ+ educators, were 
protected from employment discrimination, the 
Trump administration filed a legal brief arguing that 
a Catholic school had a right to fire a teacher for 
being gay7 as well as worked to avoid enforcing this 
decision, particularly focusing on limiting the rights 
of transgender people.8  

In January of 2021, midway through the 
2020–2021 school year, President Biden was 
inaugurated, marking a transfer of executive and 
federal power to an administration that took steps 
to support and protect the right of LGBTQ+ people, 
including LGBTQ+ students. Soon after taking 
office, the administration took action to reinstate 
protections that had been reversed in the previous 
administration, and to put in place executive orders 
to protect LGBTQ+ people. Specifically important 
for LGBTQ+ students, the administration signed 
an executive order in January 2021 affirming 
that the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock vs. 
Clayton County that workplace protections against 
discrimination include discrimination based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity applies 
not only to workplaces but also to education (in 
addition to housing, health care, and credit).9 
Additionally, in 2021, the Department of Education 
declared that Title IX protections apply to LGBTQ+ 
students, and that students are protected from 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity.10 

Although these federal actions communicate a 
clear support for LGBTQ+ people, they may not 
have had a profound effect on the experiences of 
students in the 2020–2021 school year, given 
that the inauguration occurred in the middle of 
the school year. Regardless of the progress we 

2

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYhave seen on the federal level, state and local 
authorities and legislation may have more of an 
impact on education, and on experiences of U.S. 
students, especially LGBTQ+ students. In fact, in 
2021, many states introduced and argued bills 
about prohibiting the inclusion of diversity topics 
in school curriculum, specifically with regard to 
teaching about race, racism, and the experiences 
of people of color, 11 and more recently, similar 
bills have targeted inclusion of LGBTQ+ topics in 
curricula.12 Additionally, in 2021, states across 
the country continued to propose, and in some 
instances pass, bills banning transgender students 
from participating in school sports, preventing 
transgender and nonbinary students from having 
the same opportunities at school as their cisgender 
peers.13 These battles in state legislatures and 
in school boards have sparked local, state-wide, 
and national conversations about the rights of 
students, educators, and marginalized populations 
in schools, including LGBTQ+ youth and youth of 
color. This, in turn, brought negative attention to 
these issues in the public discourse, and may have 
influenced public opinion, creating more negative 
attitudes about LGBTQ+ issues and students 
across the country. 

Most, if not all, students in the U.S. during 
the 2020–2021 school year were impacted by 
COVID-19, as schools had to adapt in the wake 
of the pandemic, drastically changing how many 
students experienced schools. Whereas some 
schools were open and had students attend in-
person for the entire 2020–2021, many schools 
introduced alternative learning environments 
– some schools remained entirely online for the 
school year and others employed hybrid learning 
environments, wherein students attended some 
of the year in person and some online. At the 
beginning of the 2020–2021 school year, only four 
states (Arkansas, Florida, Iowa, and Texas) required 
an in-person learning option for students.14 Online-
only instruction was much more common at the 
beginning of the year, with 74% of the 100 largest 
school districts in the country starting the school 
year with this form of learning environment.15 As 
the school year progressed, more school districts 
transitioned to some form of in-person instruction, 
and by November of 2020, 19% of school districts 
provided only online instruction, 36% provided 
only in-person instruction, and 45% of districts 
used a hybrid model.16 By the end of the school 
year, 12 states had required all schools to be open, 
and an estimated 1% of districts in the U.S. were 

online only, 53% were in-person only, and 46% 
were hybrid.17 Some form of online learning, either 
only online or hybrid online and in-person was very 
common in the 2020–2021 school year. 

While online schooling was instituted to protect 
students, their families, and school personnel from 
risk of COVID-19 infection, many predicted that 
it would be associated with an array of negative 
outcomes. Little research exists to date describing 
the effects of COVID on youth’s school experiences, 
and the experiences of youth in online learning. 
The little research that does exist suggests that, 
in general, students who attended school remotely 
had poorer perceptions about school and reported 
lower levels of social, emotional, and academic 
well-being than classmates who attended school 
in person.18 Specific to LGBTQ+ youth, one study 
from early in the pandemic found that LGBTQ+ 
youth were concerned about being at home with 
unsupportive parents and no longer having access 
to supportive spaces at school, although some also 
reported greater opportunity for personal reflection 
about identity.19

More of the research about youth and COVID 
has examined the mental health effects of the 
pandemic on youth. The Center for Disease 
Control’s (CDC) Adolescent Behaviors and 
Experiences Survey (ABES), conducted in early–
mid 2021, found that a third of high school 
students in general experienced poor mental health 
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and almost half 
reported feeling persistently sad or hopeless.20 The 
CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System 
(YRBSS) found in previous years that LGBQ youth 
reported poorer mental health and higher rates of 
suicide-related behavior, and data from the ABES 
shows that this disparity persisted during the 
COVID pandemic.21 Additionally, the ABES found 
that during the 2020–2021 school year when 
many youth attended school online, LGBQ students 
were more likely to report parental abuse and 
greater difficulty in completing their schoolwork 
than other students. Polling data from the Trevor 
Project from July 2020 also showed that 35% 
of LGBTQ youth felt “much more lonely since 
the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,” which was 
significantly higher than the rate among cisgender 
heterosexual youth.22 

Many posit that online learning reduced youth’s 
experiences of bullying, particularly among 
marginalized students who experience identity-

3

based bullying, including youth of color and 
youth with disabilities, although research and 
data supporting this hypothesis is scarce.23 An 
examination of a general population of youth’s 
internet use showed a decrease in searches about 
school bullying and cyberbullying during the 
pandemic compared to pre-pandemic rates.24 One 
study of rural, low-income neurodivergent youth 
found that during the lockdown period of the 
pandemic, these students experienced less bullying 
than they did before the pandemic.25 Specifically 
regarding LGBTQ+ youth, one study compared 
data from LGBTQ+ youth before and during the 
pandemic and found that LGBTQ+ youth reported 
higher levels of anxiety in 2021 than those 
in 2018, but they also reported lower rates of 
victimization, and fewer suicide attempts.26 More 
research is needed to examine the effects of school 
closures and online schooling on LGBTQ+ youth’s 
school experiences. To address this need, this year 
we adapted our survey to account for the various 
learning environment that students experienced 
in the 2020–2021 school year, and we discuss 
important differences when they arise. Additionally, 
we provide findings about the difference in 
availability of LGBTQ+ supportive resources by 
learning environment. 

The field of research on LGBTQ+ youth has 
continued to grow, and national research has 
been done to examine LGBTQ+ youth in general 
by the government and by other organizations. 
For example, the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention (CDC) Division of Adolescent and 
School Health (DASH) added questions about 
sexual orientation to the federal and standard 
versions of their Youth Risk Behavior Survey 
(YRBS) in 2015. Additionally, CDC DASH has 
begun asking students about transgender identity. 
In 2017, this question was piloted in 19 Youth 
Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) sites, 
and in 2019, the item was approved for use as 
an optional question available for all YRBSS sites 
to use. These changes will allow policymakers 

and educators to collect state and local data 
about, and better understand the experiences 
of transgender youth in their states or localities. 
Recent results from the national 2019 YRBS data 
reveal that lesbian, gay, and bisexual students are 
at greater risk for most adverse health outcomes, 
including school violence.27 Further, the 2017 
YRBS results from 14 locations that asked about 
transgender identity similarly reveal a greater risk 
for adverse health outcomes among transgender 
students, compared to their cisgender peers.28 
The Trevor Project’s National Survey on LGBTQ+ 
Mental Health contributes invaluable data about 
LGBTQ+ youth’s mental health and information on 
how to best provide care and support;29 however, 
their research contains limited information about 
school experiences. Given that the YRBS is focused 
specifically on health risk behaviors, and the Trevor 
Project’s report is focused on mental health, both 
surveys include limited items specifically related to 
the school environment. GLSEN’s National School 
Climate survey continues to be vitally important 
to the understanding of the school experiences of 
LGBTQ+ students nationally.

The 2021 NSCS offers a broad understanding 
of the policies, practices, and conditions that 
make LGBTQ+ students more vulnerable to 
discrimination and victimization at school and 
examines how these hostile experiences impact 
their educational success and trajectories. This 
year, the report also provides an examination of 
how LGBTQ+ students’ school experiences were 
impacted by COVID-19 and the different learning 
environments that resulted from the pandemic. 
Given that we have been conducting the NSCS for 
over twenty years, we continue to examine changes 
over time on measures of school climate and 
levels of access to LGBTQ+-related resources in 
schools. The 2021 NSCS report offers advocates, 
educators, and policymakers up-to-date and 
valuable information that will strengthen their  
work in creating safe and affirming schools for  
all students.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYMETHODS AND 
SAMPLE

Participants completed an online survey about 
their experiences in school during the 2020–2021 
school year, including hearing biased remarks, 
feeling safe, experiencing harassment or assault, 
feeling comfortable in school, and experiencing 
discriminatory actions by the school. They were 
also asked about their academic experiences, 
attitudes about school, involvement in school, and 
availability of supportive school resources. Youth 
were eligible to participate in the survey if they 
were at least 13 years of age, attended a K–12 
school in the United States during the 2020–21 
school year, and identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
pansexual, queer, or a sexual orientation other than 
heterosexual (e.g., homoflexible, questioning) or 
described themselves as transgender or as having 
another gender identity that is not cisgender 
(“cisgender” describes a person whose gender 
identity is aligned with the sex/gender they were 
assigned at birth). Data collection occurred 
between April and August 2021.

The survey was available online through GLSEN’s 
website. The survey and survey outreach materials 
were available in English and Spanish. Notices 
and announcements were sent through GLSEN’s 
email and chapter networks, SMS messages to 
GLSEN constituents, and on GLSEN’s social 
media pages including Facebook, Instagram and 
Twitter. Additionally, national, regional, and local 
organizations that provide services to or advocate 
on behalf of LGBTQ+ youth posted notices about 
the survey on listservs, websites, and social 
network accounts. To ensure representation of 
transgender and gender nonconforming youth, 
youth of color, and youth in rural communities, 
additional outreach efforts were made to notify 
groups and organizations that work predominantly 
with these populations about the survey.

Contacting participants only through LGBTQ+ 
youth-serving groups and organizations would have 
limited our ability to reach LGBTQ+ students who 
were not connected to or engaged in LGBTQ+ 
communities in some way. Thus, in order to 
broaden our reach to LGBTQ+ students who may 
not have had such connections, we conducted 
targeted outreach and advertising through social 
media sites. Specifically, we broadly advertised 
the survey on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, 
and Snapchat to U.S. users between 13 and 
18 years of age who had interests aligned with 
LGBTQ+ communities and issues. To ensure 
representation of groups who have historically 

been underrepresented in national surveys of 
LGBTQ+ youth and past GLSEN surveys, including 
transgender girls, LGBTQ+ youth of color, and 
cisgender gay, bisexual, and queer boys, additional 
advertisements were targeted specifically to 
these groups. Additionally, GLSEN reached out 
to “influencers,” or well-known young actors and 
social media personalities, with large LGBTQ+ 
youth audiences and asked them to post or talk 
about the survey on their social media pages. 
Information about the survey was also posted on 
subgroups or pages of social media sites with 
significant LGBTQ+ youth content or LGBTQ+ 
youth followers.

The final sample consisted of a total of 22,298 
students between the ages of 13 and 21. 
Students came from all 50 states, the District 
of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin 
Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands. Table 
M1 presents participants’ demographic and 
educational characteristics, and Table M2 shows 
the characteristics of the schools attended by 
participants. As shown in Table M1, 67.2% was 
White, 33.8% identified as cisgender and 31.5% 
as nonbinary, and 30.1% identified as bisexual 
and 28.8% as gay or lesbian. A third of students 
reported their family religion as nondenominational 
Christian (36.5%), although less than a third 
(30.9%) reported that they themselves identified 
with their family’s religion. Students were most 
commonly in 9th, 10th, and 11th grades (see also 
Table M1). As shown in Table M2, the majority of 
LGBTQ+ students were in public schools (88.1%) 
and nearly half (44.6%) were from suburban 
schools. Compared to national public school 
enrollment,30 our sample included more students 
from the North and Midwest and fewer students 
from the South and West.31

As shown in Table M2, the majority of the LGBTQ+ 
students in the survey (63.4%) had been in hybrid 
learning environments (i.e., having had classes 
both online and in-person), and the minority 
(11.7%) had been in in-person only learning 
environments. Across all school characteristics, 
there were significant differences by type of 
learning environments, as also shown in Table M2:

• School Level: Students in K-12 and lower 
schools (combined elementary and middle 
school grades) and in middle schools were 
less likely to have been in online only learning 
environments, whereas students in high schools 

6

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYwere more likely to have been in online only 
learning environments. It may be that schools 
that include younger students were more 
likely in general to return to in-person learning 
environments than schools with older students.

• Locale: Students in urban and suburban 

schools were most likely to have been in online 
only learning environments, whereas students 
in rural schools were most likely to have been 
in in-person learning environments.

• School Type: Public school students and 

• Region: Students in the Northeast and West 

private non-religious school students were 
somewhat less likely to have been in in-person 
only learning environments and religious school 
students were more likely to have been in in-
person learning environments. 

were much less likely to have been in in-person 
learning environments, whereas student in the 
South and Midwest were much more likely to 
have been in in-person learning environments.

CLIMATE 

SCHOOL SAFETY

Overall Safety at School

Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and Gender 
Expression (SOGIE) Characteristics. Many 
LGBTQ+ students feel unsafe in school. Four 
in five LGBTQ+ students (81.8%) in our survey 
reported feeling unsafe in school because of at 
least one of their actual or perceived personal 
characteristics. Notably, the most common reason 
that LGBTQ+ students gave for feeling unsafe in 
school concerned their SOGIE (sexual orientation, 
gender identity and/or gender expression) 
characteristics — 68.0% reported that they felt 
unsafe in school because of one or more of these 
characteristics. As shown in Figure 1.1, the most 
common reason for feeling unsafe, regarding their 
SOGIE characteristics, was their sexual orientation. 

Other Personal Characteristics. LGBTQ+ students 
also reported feeling unsafe in school because of a 
variety of characteristics outside of their LGBTQ+ 
identities, including: body size or weight, family’s 
income or economic status, academic ability, 
citizenship status, race or ethnicity, developmental 
or physical disability, mental health or emotional 
disability, or religion. As shown in Figure 1.2, 
LGBTQ+ students most commonly felt unsafe in 
school because of their mental health or emotional 
disability, followed by their body size or weight.41

• Over half of LGBTQ+ students (61.6%) 

reported feeling unsafe in school because of 
their mental health or emotional disability;

• Over a third (42.1%) reported feeling unsafe

• One-quarter (25.9%) reported feeling unsafe 

because of their academic ability. 

A smaller percentage of LGBTQ+ students reported 
feeling unsafe for other personal characteristics, 
such as their religion or their race or ethnicity.

We also asked students to tell us if they felt unsafe 
in school for another reason not included in the 
listed characteristics and, if so, why. As shown in 
Figure 1.2, 3.2% of survey participants reported 
feeling unsafe in school for other reasons, most 
commonly due to a fear of sexual harassment 
or sexual violence, their political beliefs, or gun 
violence. 

Overall, LGBTQ+ students in online-only learning 
environments were least likely to feel unsafe at 
school due to a personal characteristic and those 
in in-person only learning environments were most 
likely.42 This pattern largely held true when we 
examined each type of personal characteristic, with 
the exception that there were no differences across 
the groups with regard to feeling unsafe because of 
race/ethnicity, a physical disability, family income, 
citizenship status or English language ability.43 
Being in classes online at home rather than in a 
school buildling may provide LGBTQ+ students 
with some feelings of protection from their peers. 

School Engagement and Safety Concerns

Students who feel unsafe in school may choose 
to avoid the particular areas or activities where 
they feel most unwelcomed. For some students, 
they may feel the need to avoid attending school 
altogether. Thus, a hostile school climate can 
impact an LGBTQ+ student’s ability to fully engage 
and participate with the school community. 

Avoiding Spaces. To examine this possible 
restriction of LGBTQ+ students’ school 
engagement, we asked LGBTQ+ students if 
there were particular spaces in school that they 
avoided specifically because they felt unsafe 
or uncomfortable. As shown in Figure 1.3, 
LGBTQ+ students most commonly avoided 
school bathrooms, locker rooms, and physical 

10

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYeducation or gym classes, with approximately 
4 in 10 students avoiding each of these spaces 
because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable (45.1%, 
42.6%, and 39.4% respectively).44 One-quarter 
of LGBTQ+ students avoided school athletic fields 
or facilities (24.3%) or the school cafeteria or 
lunchroom (22.2%) because they felt unsafe or 
uncomfortable.

Avoiding Functions and Extracurricular Activities. 
In addition to avoiding certain spaces in school 

because of safety reasons, LGBTQ+ students may 
also avoid other more social aspects of student 
life, for similar fears for personal safety. For 
any student, involvement in school community 
activities like clubs or special events can have a 
positive impact on students’ sense of belonging in 
school, self-esteem, and academic achievement. 
However, LGBTQ+ students who do not feel safe 
or comfortable in these environments may not 
have full access to the benefits of engaging in 
these school activities. Thus, we specifically

asked students who had been in school in-person 
at some point during the academic year if they 
avoided school functions or other school activities 
outside of class, such as extracurricular activities 
because of feeling unsafe or uncomfortable. 
Most LGBTQ+ students reported avoiding school 
functions and activities outside of school to some 
extent (78.8%), and nearly a third avoided them 
often or frequently combined (14.5% and 15.2%, 
respectively; see Figure 1.4). Overall, LGBTQ+ 
students who had been only in in-person learning 
environments did not differ from those who had 
been in hybrid learning environments with regard 
to avoiding spaces at school.45 These high rates of 
avoiding school activities indicate that LGBTQ+ 
students may be discouraged from participating in 
these important aspects of school communities.

Avoiding School. Feeling unsafe or uncomfortable 
in school can negatively affect the ability of 
students to thrive and succeed academically, 
particularly if it results in avoiding school 
altogether. When asked about absenteeism, about 
one third (32.2%) of LGBTQ+ students reported 
missing at least one entire day of school in the past 
month because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable, 
and just over a tenth (11.3%) missed four or 
more days in the past month (see Figure 1.5). 
LGBTQ+ students who were only in online learning 
environments during the academic year reported 
somewhat fewer days of missing school than 
those who had only been in in-person learning 
environments and those who had been in hybrid 
learning environments.46 Additionally, in some 
cases, the school environment may be so hostile

school, and one in six (16.2%) LGBTQ+ students 
reported ever having had changed schools due to 
feeling unsafe and uncomfortable (see Figure 1.6).

Our findings suggest that the majority of LGBTQ+ 
youth do not feel safe at their school. Often this 
is because of their sexual orientation, gender 
expression, and/or gender identity. Students may 
avoid spaces and activities where they experience 
these feelings of unsafety; many frequently avoid 
school spaces and activities in school, and some 
avoid school altogether. These high rates of 
avoiding or leaving school and/or school activities 
indicate that LGBTQ+ students may be discouraged 
from full participation in school life, and for some, 
are being denied equal access to their education 
because of a hostile school climate.

EXPOSURE TO BIASED LANGUAGE

Keeping classrooms and hallways free of 
homophobic, sexist, racist, and other types of biased 
language helps create a more positive school climate 
for all students. In order to assess this feature of 
school climate, we asked LGBTQ+ students about 
their experiences with hearing anti-LGBTQ+ remarks 
and other types of biased remarks while at school, 
and the response to this biased language. 

Hearing Anti-LGBTQ+ Remarks at School

We asked students in our survey about the 
frequency with which they heard homophobic 
remarks (such as “faggot” and “dyke,” the word 
“gay” being used in a negative way, or the phrase 
“no homo”). We also asked about the frequency 
of hearing negative remarks about the way 
students expressed their gender at school (such as 
comments related to a female student not acting 
“feminine enough”) and negative remarks about 
transgender people (such as “tranny” or “he/ 
she”). Further, we also asked students about the 
frequency of hearing these types of remarks from 
both students and school staff. 

Homophobic Remarks. The most common form of 
homophobic language that was heard by LGBTQ+ 
students in our survey was “gay” being used 
in a negative way at school, such as comments 
like “that’s so gay” or “you’re so gay.” 47 As 
shown in Figure 1.7, over two-thirds of LGBTQ+ 
students (68.0%) reported hearing these types 
of comments often or frequently in their schools. 
These expressions are often used to mean that 
something or someone is stupid or worthless and, 
thus, may be dismissed as innocuous by school 
authorities and students in comparison to overtly 

derogatory remarks such as “faggot” or “dyke.” 
However, many LGBTQ+ students did not view 
these expressions as innocuous. In fact, 93.7% of 
LGBTQ+ students reported that hearing “gay” used 
in a negative manner caused them to feel bothered 
or distressed to some degree (see Figure 1.8).

“No homo”48 was also heard regularly by students. 
The majority of LGBTQ+ students (63.3%) reported 
hearing this remark often or frequently in their 
schools (see also Figure 1.7). LGBTQ+ students 
were less bothered by hearing “no homo” than they 
were by hearing “gay” used in a negative way.49 
Nevertheless, 71.2% of students reported that they 
were bothered or distressed to some degree when 
they heard the phrase (see also Figure 1.8). 

Other types of homophobic remarks (such as 
“fag” or “dyke”) were less commonly reported 
by LGBTQ+ students. These remarks were 
nevertheless heard often or frequently at school by 
nearly half (44.2%) of students in our survey (see 
also Figure 1.7). 

We also asked LGBTQ+ students who heard 
homophobic remarks in school how pervasive this 
behavior was among the student population. As 
shown in Figure 1.9, just over one-fifth of students 
(21.6%) reported that these types of remarks 
were made by most of their peers. Furthermore, 
and perhaps even more disconcerting, more than 
half of students (58.0%) reported ever hearing 
homophobic remarks from their teachers or other 
school staff (see Figure 1.10).

express themselves in a manner considered to be 
atypical may experience criticism, harassment, and 
sometimes violence. Thus, we asked students in 
our survey two separate questions about hearing 
comments related to a student’s gender expression: 
one question asked how often they heard remarks 
about someone not acting “masculine enough,” 
and another question asked how often they heard 
comments about someone not acting “feminine 
enough.” Findings from this survey demonstrate 
that negative remarks about someone’s gender 
expression were pervasive in schools. Overall, as 
shown previously in Figure 1.7, 56.2% of students 

reported hearing some or most students make 
either type of remark about someone’s gender 
expression at school. In addition, Figure 1.11 
shows the frequency of hearing remarks about 
other students not acting “masculine enough” and 
not acting “feminine enough” separately — remarks 
related to students not acting “masculine enough” 
were found to be more common than remarks 
related to students not acting “feminine enough.”50 
About half of students (49.1%) heard negative 
comments related to students’ masculinity 
regularly (i.e., often or frequently), compared to 
over a third of students (37.4%) that regularly 
heard comments related to students’ femininity.

When asked how much of the student population 
made these types of remarks, almost a fifth of 
students (18.4%) reported that most of their peers 
made negative remarks about someone’s gender 
expression (see Figure 1.9). Further, nearly 72.0% 
of students had heard teachers or other school 
staff make negative comments about a student’s 
gender expression (see Figure 1.10). Unlike biased 
remarks heard from other students, LGBTQ+ 
students heard school staff make negative remarks 
about gender expression more frequently than 
homophobic remarks.51

Negative Remarks About Transgender People. 
Similar to negative comments about gender 
expression, people may make negative comments 
about transgender people because they can pose 
a challenge to “traditional” ideas about gender. 
Therefore, we asked students about how often 
they heard negative remarks specifically about 
transgender people, like “tranny” or “he/she.” 
Two-fifths of LGBTQ+ students (39.5%) in our 
survey reported hearing these comments often or 
frequently (see Figure 1.7). 

Overall, students who attended school only in-
person heard anti-LGBTQ+ remarks more frequently 
than did students who attended school only online 
or in a hybrid setting.52 Further, students who 
attended school only in-person reported that they 
heard homophobic remarks and negative remarks 
about gender expression from more of their peers in 
their school than did students who attended school

online (either hybrid or online only).53 It is likely that 
students who attended school in-person, whether 
it was fully in-person or only part of the academic 
year, heard biased remarks outside of the classroom 
setting, in places such as hallways, cafeterias, and 
other school spaces. Additionally, students who 
attended school in person might be more likely to 
overhear face-to-face conversations among their 
peers. Students who attended school online would 
likely not have had much access to school spaces 
outside of the classroom, and were only around 
other students and teachers in online classroom 
settings. These online spaces likely provided fewer 
opportunities for biased remarks to be made, as they 
would often have to be made in front of the whole 
virtual classroom, including the teacher. 

Homophobic remarks and negative remarks about 
gender expression from staff were also more 
commonly reported among students who attended 
school only in-person compared to students who 
attended school online (either hybrid or only 
online).54 In-person school likely provided more 
opportunity for students to hear teachers and 
school staff make biased remarks in spaces outside 
of the classroom and in overheard conversations. 
Additionally, adults may be overheard by students 
when making these kinds of remarks to other 
adults when in school buildings, but perhaps less 
likely in a virtual school setting.

Any negative remark about sexual orientation, 
gender identity, or gender expression may signal to 
LGBTQ+ students that they are unwelcome in their 
school communities, even if a specific negative 
comment is not directly applicable to the individual 
student who hears it. For example, negative 
comments about gender expression may disparage 
transgender or LGB people, even if transgender-
specific or homophobic slurs are not used.

Intervention in Anti-LGBTQ+ Remarks 

The pervasiveness of anti-LGBTQ+ remarks in all 
learning environments is a concerning contribution 
to hostile school climates for all LGBTQ+ students. 
The willingness of others at school to intervene 
when hearing this kind of language may be another 
important indicator of school climate. To better 
understand if and how biased remarks are being 
addressed and interrupted when they are heard in 
schools, we asked students about staff and other 
students’ intervention on homophobic remarks and 
negative remarks about gender expression.55

16

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYIntervention in Homophobic Remarks. Students 
who reported hearing homophobic remarks at 
school were asked how often homophobic remarks 
were made in the presence of teachers or other 
school staff, and whether staff intervened when 
present. Almost a third of students (31.7%) in our 
survey reported that school staff members were 
present all or most of the time when homophobic 
remarks were made. When school staff were 
present, the use of biased and derogatory language 
by students remained largely unchallenged. For 
example, 12.3% reported that school personnel 
intervened most of the time or always when 
homophobic remarks were made in their presence, 
and half (50.3%) reported that staff never 
intervened when hearing homophobic remarks 
(see Figure 1.12). One would expect teachers 
and school staff to bear the responsibility for 
addressing problems of biased language in school. 
Although, given that school personnel are often not 
present during these incidents, students may also 
intervene when hearing biased language. However, 
less than a tenth of students (8.7%) reported that 
their peers intervened always or most of the time 
when hearing homophobic remarks, and more than 
half (53.4%) said their peers never intervened (see 
also Figure 1.12). 

Intervention in Gender-Biased Remarks Almost 
a third of students (30.8%) in our survey who 
heard negative remarks about gender expression 
reported that school staff members were present 
all or most of the time when these remarks were 
made. In addition, intervention by educators on 
gender expression remarks was even less common 
than intervention on homophobic remarks.56 For 
example, 8.8% of LGBQT+ students reported that 
school staff intervened most of the time or always 
when remarks about gender expression were made 
in their presence (see Figure 1.13), compared 
to 10.9% of LGBTQ+ students who reported 
that school staff intervened most of the time 
or always on homophobic remarks, respectively 
(see Figure 1.13). The high frequency of hearing 
these remarks, coupled with the fact that these 
comments are so rarely challenged by adults at 
school, suggests that acceptance of a range of 
gender expressions may be relatively uncommon  
in schools.

students who attended school only online were 
least likely.57 Students who attended school online 
likely only saw one teacher at a time, during their 
online instruction. However, students who went to 
school in-person, for any part of the year, saw and 
interacted with teachers and staff beyond those 
who taught the classes they were in. Because of 
this greater availability of and access to teachers 
and school staff, it is understandable that students 
who attended school in person would report 
greater presence of these adults than students who 
attended school online. 

Although teachers and staff were more likely to be 
present when anti-LGBTQ+ remarks were made 
in in-school learning environments than in online 
only settings, students who were in in-person only 
learning environments reported the lowest levels of 
staff intervention on these remarks.58 This finding 
illustrates that simply having adults present more 
often is not enough to ensure affirming school 
environments free of biased language, and suggests 
that more training is needed to provide school staff 
with the skills they need to intervene when anti-
LGBTQ+ remarks are made. In contrast, the rates 
of student intervention on homophobic remarks 
and negative remarks about gender expression were 
similar across the types of learning environments.59 

These findings indicate that the majority of 
LGBTQ+ students report rampant usage of 
anti-LGBTQ+ remarks in their schools, which 
contributes to a hostile learning environment for

LGBTQ+ students. Infrequent intervention by 
school authorities when hearing such language 
in school may send a message to students that 
homophobic language is tolerated. Furthermore, 
school staff may be modeling poor behavior and 
legitimizing the use of anti-LGBTQ+ language, 
in that many students in our 2021 survey heard 
school staff make homophobic and transphobic 
remarks themselves.

Hearing Other Types of Biased Remarks  
at School

In addition to hearing anti-LGBTQ+ remarks at 
school, hearing other types of biased language 
is also an important indicator of school climate 
for LGBTQ+ students. We asked students about 
their experiences hearing racist remarks, sexist 
remarks, negative remarks about other students’ 
ability, negative remarks about other students’ 
religion, negative remarks about other students’ 
body size or weight, and negative remarks about 
students’ immigration status at school. For most 
of these types of remarks, LGBTQ+ students in 
our survey reported that they were commonplace 
at their schools, although some comments were 
more prevalent than others (see Figure 1.14).60 
Sexist remarks were the most commonly heard 
remark — even more so than homophobic remarks. 
The majority of LGBTQ+ students (75.7%) heard 
sexist remarks regularly (i.e., frequently or often) 
at their school and nearly three-quarters (72.6%) 
heard negative remarks about students’ ability/
disability regularly. Negative remarks about 
students’ weight or body size and racist remarks 
were also very commonly heard types of biased 

remarks; with over half having heard these types 
of remarks regularly from other students (60.0% 
and 54.7%, respectively). Comments about religion 
were somewhat less common, with a quarter 
(24.8%) reporting hearing negative remarks 
about other students’ religion from other students 
regularly. Least commonly heard were negative 
remarks about students’ immigration status, with 
almost a fifth (18.3%) reporting that they heard 
them regularly at school. For all of these other 
types of biased remarks, students who were only in 
in-person learning environments reported hearing 
them more frequently than did students who were 
only in online learning environments and those in 
hybrid learning environments.61

Hearing biased or derogatory language is a 
common occurrence at school, and most teachers 
and other school authorities did not consistently 
intervene when these remarks were made in their 
presence, with regard to homophobic remarks and 
negative remarks about gender expression. Thus, 
the pervasive use of biased language would remain 
largely unchallenged. In order to ensure schools are 
welcoming and safe for LGBTQ+ students, teachers 
and other school personnel need to make clear 
to students that such biased remarks will not be 
tolerated. Although homophobic and sexist remarks 
were most commonly heard at school, other types 
of remarks were also common, such as remarks 
about a students’ ability or body size or weight. 
As such, any type of biased remark tolerated in 
school can create an unwelcoming environment 
for all students, and especially for students with 
marginalized identities.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYEXPERIENCES OF HARASSMENT AND ASSAULT AT SCHOOL

Hearing anti-LGBTQ+ remarks in school can 
contribute to feeling unsafe and create a negative 
learning environment. However, direct experiences 
with harassment and assault may have even more 
serious consequences on the lives of students. 
Because students in the U.S. were in different 
types of learning environments during the 2020–
2021 academic year due to COVID, we asked 
those who were in school in person for all or part 
of the year about their experiences with in-person 
harassment and assault and we asked those who 
were in school online for all or part of the year 
about their experiences with online harassment. 

The vast majority of LGBTQ+ students who 
attended school in-person for all or part of the 
school year (83.1%) experienced in-person 
harassment or assault based on personal 
characteristics, including sexual orientation, 
gender expression, gender, and actual or perceived 
race and ethnicity, religion, and disability. Half of 
students who attended school online for all or for 
part of the school year (50.7%) experienced online 
harassment based on personal characteristics. 

Harassment and Assault Based on  
Sexual Orientation, Gender, and  
Gender Expression

In-Person Harassment and Assault. We asked 
survey participants who had attended school in 
person how often (“never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” 
“often,” or “frequently”) they had been verbally 
harassed, physically harassed, or physically 
assaulted at school during the past year specifically 
based on sexual orientation, gender, and gender 
expression (e.g., not acting “masculine” or 
“feminine enough”). Overall, students in in-person 
only learning environments experienced higher 
rates of harassment and assault based on sexual 
orientation, gender, and gender expression than did 
students who were in hybrid learning environments 
(i.e., attended school both in-person and online).62

Verbal harassment. An overwhelming majority 
(76.1%) reported being verbally harassed (e.g., 
been called names or threatened) at school 
specifically based on sexual orientation, gender 
expression, and gender at some point in the 
past year, and over a third (29.8%) experienced 
higher frequencies (often or frequently) of verbal 
harassment based on any of these characteristics. 

LGBTQ+ students most commonly reported 
experiencing verbal harassment at school based  
on their sexual orientation and gender expression 
(see Figure 1.15):63

• Six in ten LGBTQ+ students (60.7%) were 
verbally harassed at school in the past year 
based on their sexual orientation; 16.6% 
experienced this harassment often or frequently;

• Over half (51.3%) of LGBTQ+ students were 
verbally harassed at school in the past year 
based on their gender; 16.0% experienced this 
harassment often or frequently; and 

• A majority of LGBTQ+ students (57.4%) 
were verbally harassed at school in the 
past year based on their gender expression; 
18.0% experienced this harassment often or 
frequently.

Physical harassment. Over a third of LGBTQ+ 
students (31.2%) had been physically harassed 
(e.g., shoved or pushed) at some point at school 
during the past year based on their sexual 
orientation, gender expression, or gender. Students 
most commonly reported being physically harassed 
at school based on their sexual orientation, 
followed by gender expression and gender (see 
Figure 1.16):64

• Approximately a quarter of LGBTQ+ students 

(22.4%) were physically harassed at school in 
the past year based on their sexual orientation; 
4.4% experienced this harassment often or 
frequently; 

• Over a fifth of LGBTQ+ students (20.5%) were 
physically harassed at school in the past year 
based on their gender; 4.4% experienced this 
harassment often or frequently; and

• More than a fifth of LGBTQ+ students (20.6%) 

were physically harassed at school in the 
past year based on their gender expression; 
4.5% experienced this harassment often or 
frequently.

Physical assault. More than a tenth (12.5%) of 
LGBTQ+ students in our survey reported being 
physically assaulted (e.g., being punched, kicked, 
or injured with a weapon) in school during the past 

19

year based on their sexual orientation, gender, or 
gender expression. Although these experiences may 
be less common than experiences of verbal and 
physical harassment, it is a more serious form of 
victimization. As shown in Figure 1.17, students 
experienced physical assault based on sexual 
orientation, gender, and gender expression at similar 
rates ( As these forms of physical assault are rare 
and students report low rates, it is unsurprising that 
they did not differ based on type):65. 

• 8.8% of LGBTQ+ students were physically 

assaulted at school in the past year based on 
their sexual orientation;

• 8.3% of LGBTQ+ students were physically 
assaulted at school in the past year school 
based on their gender; and

• 8.2% of LGBTQ+ students were physically 

assaulted at school in the past year based on 
how they expressed their gender.

Online Harassment. Participants who had attended 
school online, for either part or all of the school 
year, reported on how often (“never,” “rarely,” 
“sometimes,” “often,” or “frequently”) they had 
been harassed or threatened online or by phone 
during the school day by students from their school 
based on their sexual orientation, gender, and 
gender expression (see Figure 1.18). Of LGBTQ+ 
students who attended school online, 36.6% 
experienced online harassment based on sexual 
orientation, 30.3% based on gender, and 31.8% 

based on gender expression. Students who were 
in online only learning environments experienced 
higher rates of online harassment and assault 
based on sexual orientation, gender, and gender 
expression than those who were in hybrid learning 
environments.66

Harassment and Assault Based on  
Other Identity-Based Characteristics

In-Person Harassment and Assault. Although 
harassment based on gender and sexuality may 
be the most salient type of victimization for many 
LGBTQ+ students, students also may be victimized 
at school for other reasons, given that LGBTQ+ 
students, like all people, hold multiple identities. 
We also asked LGBTQ+ students about their 
experiences with in-person harassment related 
to other identity-based characteristics, including 
their religion, their actual or perceived race or 
ethnicity, and an actual or perceived emotional, 
developmental, or physical disability. Students 
who attended school in person were asked how 
often in the past year they have been verbally 
harassed (e.g., been called names or threatened), 
physically harassed (e.g., shoved or pushed), or 
physically assaulted (e.g., being punched, kicked, 
or injured with a weapon) based on their disability, 
their religion, or their actual or perceived race/
ethnicity, (see Figures 1.19, 1.20, and 1.21). In 
general, harassment and assault based on these 
characteristics did not differ based on whether 
students attended school online in person, or both 
in person and online.67

Race/Ethnicity. Nearly a quarter of LGBTQ+ 
students who attended school in person 
experienced victimization at school because of 
their actual or perceived race or ethnicity (23.3%): 

• 21.7% of students experienced verbal 

harassment based on actual of perceived race/
ethnicity;

• 7.0% of students experienced physical 

harassment based on actual of perceived race/
ethnicity; and

• 3.0% of students experienced physical assault 

based on actual of perceived race/ethnicity.

Online Harassment. We asked LGBTQ+ students 
who had been in online only or hybrid learning 
environments during the academic year about 
their experiences with online harassment related 
to other identity-based characteristics, including 
their religion, their actual or perceived race or 
ethnicity, and an actual or perceived emotional, 
developmental, or physical disability (see Figure 
1.22). Among LGBTQ+ students who attended 
school online:

• 17.3% reported being harassed online based 

on their actual or perceived disability, 

• 13.2% reported being harassed online based 

on actual or perceived race or ethnicity. 

Students who only attended school online 
experienced higher rates of such online harassment 
than students who attended school both online and 
in person.68

Other Types of Harassment and  
Negative Events

LGBTQ+ students may be harassed or experience 
other negative events at school for reasons that 
are not clearly related to their gender, sexuality, 
or other identities. In our survey, we also asked 
students how often they experienced these other 
types of events in the past year, such as sexual 
harassment and deliberate property damage.

Sexual Harassment. Survey participants were asked 
how often they had experienced sexual harassment 
at school in the past year, such as unwanted 
touching or sexual remarks directed at them. 
As shown in Figure 1.23, a majority of LGBTQ+ 
students (53.7%) had been sexually harassed 
at school, and 12.2% reported that such events 
occurred often or frequently. Students who attended 
school only in person experienced the highest rates 
of sexual harassment, followed by students who 
attended school both in person and online.69

• 13.7% reported being harassed online based 

on their religion; and

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYor overt acts of aggressive behavior; however, it 
is also important to examine relational forms of 
aggression that can damage peer relationships, 
such as spreading rumors or excluding students 
from peer activities.70 We asked participants how 
often they had experienced two common forms of 
relational aggression: being purposefully excluded 
by peers and being the target of mean rumors or 
lies. As also illustrated in Figure 1.23, the vast 
majority of LGBTQ+ students (86.2%) in our 
survey reported that they had felt deliberately 
excluded or “left out” by other students, and 
nearly half (44.1%) experienced this often or 
frequently. Most LGBTQ+ students (62.3%) had 
mean rumors or lies told about them at school, and 
over a quarter (19.2%) experienced this often or 
frequently. Overall, students who attended school 
in person reported the highest levels of relational 
aggression, and students who attended school both 
in person and online reported higher rates than did 
those who only attended school online.71

Property Theft or Damage at School. Having one’s 
personal property damaged or stolen is yet another 
dimension of a hostile school climate for students. 
Over a third of LGBTQ+ students who attended 
school in person at some point in the school year 
(36.4%) reported that their property had been 
stolen or purposefully damaged by other students 
at school in the past year, and 4.2% said that such 
events had occurred often or frequently (see also 
Figure 1.23). Property damage was more common 
among students who only attended school in 
person than students who attended school both in 
person and online.72

General Experiences of Electronic Harassment 
or “Cyberbullying” 

In addition to asking students who attended 
school online at any point in the past school year 
about online harassment based on their sexual 
orientation, gender, and other identities, we asked 
these students how often they were harassed or 
threatened in general by students at their school 
via electronic media (for example, text messages, 
emails, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Facebook, 
Snapchat) outside of the school day, and 52.8% of 
those who only attended school online, and 50.4% 
of students who attended school both in person 
and online, reported experiencing this type of 
harassment in the past year. In addition, for those 
students were only in school in-person, we asked 
how often they experienced online harassment 
from students at their school and around half of 
these students (47.1%) reported experiencing  
this type of harassment in the past year. Students 
commonly reported experiencing electronic  
harassment via private messages on social media, 
text messages,and public social media posts (see 
Figure 1.24).

In this section, we found that the vast majority 
of LGBTQ+ students experienced identity-based 
harassment while attending school in-person, 
online, and in hybrid online and in-person 
settings. Our results suggest that the frequency of 
victimization was related to the type of learning 
environments the students were in. Students 
who attended school in-person for the entire year 
experienced more in-person victimization than

hybrid students who were only in person for a 
portion of the year. Similarly, online only students 
experienced more cyber harassment than hybrid 
students. Thus, students who were in hybrid 
settings experienced a lower frequency of both 
forms of victimization, but experienced both forms 
in contrast to their peers in online only or in-person 
only environments only experienced one form. 
Most often, the harassment faced by students in 
our sample targeted their LGBTQ+ identities. We 
also found that, in addition to verbal, physical, and 
online harassment and assault, LGBTQ+ students 

faced other forms of harassment, such as relational 
aggression and sexual harassment. Although we do 
not know the degree to which these other forms of 
harassment target students’ LGBTQ+ identities, 
it is likely that LGBTQ+ youth face these forms of 
peer victimization more frequently than their  
non-LGBTQ+ peers. These forms of victimization 
can have serious consequences on students’ 
academic outcomes and well-being, and we 
examine these relationships for LGBTQ+ students 
later in this report.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYREPORTING OF SCHOOL-BASED HARASSMENT  
AND ASSAULT

GLSEN advocates that anti-bullying/harassment 
measures in school must include clear processes 
for reporting by both students and staff, and 
stipulations that staff are adequately trained 
to effectively address instances of bullying 
and harassment when informed about them. 
In our survey, we asked those students who 
had experienced harassment or assault in the 
past school year how often they had reported 
the incidents to school staff. Given that family 
members may be able to advocate on behalf of the 
student with school personnel, we further asked 
students in our survey if they reported harassment 
or assault to a family member (i.e., to a parent, 
guardian, or other family member), and if family 
members intervened on their behalf with the 
school. 

As shown in Figure 1.25, over half of these 
students (61.5%) never reported incidents of 
victimization to school staff, and less than a fifth 
of students (14.5%) indicated that they reported 
these incidents to staff regularly (i.e., reporting 
“most of the time” or “always”). Less than half 
of students (42.1%) said that they had ever told 
a family member about the victimization they 
faced at school (see also Figure 1.25), and of 
those who had, only half (51.3%) reported that a 
family member had ever addressed the issue with 
school staff (see Figure 1.26). LGBTQ+ students 
who are not out to a parent or guardian may not 
be comfortable informing a parent or guardian 

about school victimization, especially if it is related 
to their LGBTQ+ identity. In fact, we found that 
students who were out as LGBTQ+ to at least 
one parent or guardian were more likely to tell 
their families about the victimization they were 
experiencing in school (49.1% vs. 26.8%).73

LGBTQ+ students’ reporting of harassment and 
assault differed somewhat based on learning 
environment (online only, hybrid, and in-person 
only). Students in in-person learning environments 
reported harassment to school staff at higher 
rates than did students in online only or hybrid 
settings.74 It is possible that students who only 
attended school in-person had more frequent and 
regular contact with school staff, and the higher 
rate of reporting among these students may be 
related to greater access to teachers and other 
school staff. Additionally, students who were in 
in-person only learning environments may have 
already been familiar with procedures for reporting 
harassment from the previous academic year, 
whereas students in online only or hybrid learning 
environments likely were in schools that had to 
make adjustments to reporting procedures to adapt 
to the online learning environment. Students in 
online, in-person, and hybrid learning did not 
differ in their reporting to family, suggesting that 
although these different learning environments may 
have impacted their relationships with adults in 
schools, it may not have had such effects on their 
relationships with adults at home.75

Reporting of Harassment or Assault in Online 
Learning Environments

As discussed above, LGBTQ+ students who 
attended school online for any portion of the 
year reported harassment and assault at a lower 
rate than students who attended school only in-
person. These students, for at least some of their 
school year, were unable to report victimization 
in person to school staff, and instead had to find 
virtual methods of communication to report their 
experiences. It is possible that it is easier or 
preferable for students to report harassment and 
assault to staff in person. In fact, we found that 
half of students (49.5%) who attended school 
online (both online only and hybrid), stated that 
they did not report victimization online and instead 
only reported these experiences to staff when 
they attended school in person. It is possible 
that students who were in some form on online 
instruction did not know how to virtually report 
harassment and assault, or had challenges in 
doing so. However, only 14.7% of students who 
attended school online (both online only and 
hybrid) reported that a reason they did not report 
victimization was challenges in online reporting. 
It may be that students find it easier to approach 
school staff in person, compared to online where 
students cannot engage face-to-face with staff 
and must find an alternative virtual method to 
communicate the experience to them.

To better understand virtual reporting methods, 
we asked students who attended school online 
(both online only and hybrid) and who reported 
experiences of victimization to staff about the 

methods they used to communicate with school 
staff. As shown in Table 1.1, among these 
students, the most common method to report 
victimization was by emailing staff (36.8%), 
followed by speaking to school staff in a private 
online meeting (13.5%). Less common methods 
included filing out an online form, sending a 
private message or speaking up in their online 
classroom, and reporting via text or phone call, 
though these methods were not particularly 
common (Table 1.1). 

Reasons for Not Reporting Harassment or 
Assault

Reporting incidents of harassment and assault 
to school staff may be an intimidating task for 
students, especially when there is no guarantee 
that reporting these incidents will result in 
effective intervention. Students who indicated that 
they had not always told school personnel about 
their experiences with harassment or assault were 
asked why they did not do so. Figure 1.27 shows 
the frequencies for the reasons given by survey 
respondents for not reporting.

As shown in Figure 1.27, among the most common 
reasons that LGBTQ+ students cited for not always 
reporting incidents of victimization to school staff 
were reasons related to doubt that doing so would 
be effective. Almost three-fourths of victimized 
students (69.6%) in our survey expressed the 
belief that school staff would not do anything 
about the harassment even if they reported it. In 
addition, about two-thirds of students (60.6%) 
believed that even if staff did do something,

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYtheir actions would not effectively address the 
victimization that they were experiencing. Many 
students (60.6%) also reported that they did not 
report incidents of victimization because they  
did not want to be perceived as a “snitch” or a  
“tattle tale.”

Many LGBTQ+ students indicated that they did 
not report instances of victimization because 
they were afraid of exacerbating an already 
hostile situation, specifically for themselves. For 
example, half of these students (50.1%) feared 
being blamed themselves, or getting in trouble 
for the harassment they faced. Furthermore, 
44.8% of students reported that they were 
concerned that reporting victimization would 
have been emotionally difficult. Additionally, 
many students did not report their harassment 

or assault to school staff due to concerns about 
confidentiality. Specifically, approximately two-
fifths of LGBTQ+ students (44.0%) in our survey 
were worried about being “outed” to school staff 
or to their family members simply by reporting the 
bias-based bullying that they were experiencing. 
Lastly, just over two-fifths of students (39.7%) 
expressed explicit safety concerns, such as fear of 
retaliation from the perpetrator if they reported the 
harassment to school staff.

LGBTQ+ students often reported that they were 
uncomfortable approaching school staff. About 
half of students said they felt too embarrassed 
or ashamed to report the incident to school 
staff members (46.8%) More than a quarter of 
students (28.7%) were deterred from reporting 
harassment or assault because they felt that

staff members at their school were homophobic 
or transphobic themselves. Perhaps the most 
troubling, however, is that nearly one-tenth of 
victimized students (8.0%) in our survey said that 
school staff members were actually part of the 
harassment or assault they were experiencing, thus 
leaving students to feel that there is no recourse 
for addressing incidents of victimization at their 
school. 

Nearly half of students (45.1%) expressed that 
they did not report incidents of victimization to 
school personnel because they did not consider 
the harassment to be serious enough to report. 
Because we lack specific details about these 
particular incidents of victimization, we cannot 
determine whether the events perceived as “not 
serious enough” to report were truly minor. We, 
nevertheless, did find that students who said they 
did not report victimization because it was “not 
that serious” had lower levels of victimization 
compared to those who did not cite this reason for 
not reporting harassment or assault.76 However, it 
is also possible that some students may convince 
themselves that their harassment is insignificant, 
and therefore not worth reporting, due to the many 
other inhibiting factors discussed throughout this 
section.

A quarter of students (24.5%) in our survey 
said they did not report harassment or assault to 
school staff because they handled the situation 
themselves. Without further information, we 
cannot know what specific actions these students 
took to address these incidents. It may be that 
they confronted the perpetrator directly, either 
instructing them to stop, or they retaliated in 
some way. However, it is a concern because such 
actions could put the victimized students at 
risk for disciplinary consequences and may not 
prevent further peer victimization. Further research 
is needed to explore the nature and possible 
consequences of the various ways students handle 
incidents of harassment themselves. 

come forward and report the victimization they are 
experiencing. In order to create a safe learning 
environment for all students, schools should work 
toward appropriately and effectively responding 
to incidents of victimization. Many of the reasons 
students gave for not reporting victimization could 
be addressed through more intentional school 
policies and practices. School staff should respond 
to each incident brought to their attention, as well 
as inform victims of the action that was taken. 
Training all members of the school community 
to be sensitive to LGBTQ+ student issues and 
effectively respond to bullying and harassment, 
could increase the likelihood of reporting by 
students who are victimized at school. Such efforts 
could, in turn, improve school climate for all 
students.

Students’ Reports on the Nature of School 
Staff’s Responses to Harassment and Assault

We asked those LGBTQ+ students who had 
reported incidents to school staff about the actions 
taken by staff in response to the most recent 
incident. As shown in Table 1.2, the most common 
response was that the staff member did nothing 
and/or told the reporting student to ignore the 
victimization (60.3%). The next most common 
responses involved staff contacting and speaking 
to individuals other than the student who reported 
victimization. A third of students (33.9%) reported 
that staff talked to the perpetrator or told them to 
stop the harassment, and fewer students reported 
that staff contacted the parents, of either the 
reporting student or the perpetrator (19.4%). Some 
students (17.3%) reported that staff provided them 
emotional support. However, concurringly, almost 
as many students (16.0%) reported that staff 
responding to reports of victimization by telling 
the student to change their behavior (e.g., not to 
act “so gay” or not to dress a certain way). Finally, 
16.0% of students reported that staff separated 
them from the perpetrator. Less common responses 
can be found in Table 1.2.

Taken together, these responses demonstrate a 
pervasive problem in our nation’s schools. It is 
clear that LGBTQ+ youth are not able to report 
experiences of harassment and/or assault in their 
schools, whether due to doubts about school staff 
taking effective action, fear of retaliation from 
perpetrators, concerns about being “outed” as 
LGBTQ+, or by simply being too embarrassed to 

Failing to intervene when harassment is reported, 
punishing students for their own victimization, 
and other inappropriate responses to reports of 
harassment and assault are unacceptable and 
potentially harmful to students who experience 
them. Staff members who do not address reports 
of student victimization not only fail to help the 
victimized student, but also may discourage other 

28

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYstudents from reporting when they are harassed or 
assaulted at school.

Staff responses to reports of harassment and 
assault were similar across all three learning 
environments.77 The one exception was that 
students who were in in-person only learning 
environments were more likely to report being told 
to ignore the harassment than students who were 
in online only or hybrid learning environments. 
Staff doing nothing or taking no action and staff 
telling students to ignore the victimization were 
the two most commonly reported staff responses, 
regardless of whether students went to school 
in-person or online. These inappropriate and 
potentially harmful responses persist across all 
learning environments suggesting that all educators 

require more/better training on how to intervene 
and respond to incidents of LGBTQ+-based 
harassment and assault.

Effectiveness of Staff Responses to 
Harassment and Assault

In our survey, students who said that they reported 
incidents of harassment and assault to school staff 
were also asked how effective staff members were 
in addressing the problem. As shown in Figure 
1.28, just over a quarter of students (26.6%) 
believed that staff responded effectively to their 
reports of victimization. Students’ reports of 
effectiveness of staff response did not differ by 
learning environment.78

Although these findings about ineffective responses 
may suggest a lack of care on the part of staff, they 
may also be indicative of school staff who are well-
meaning but are also misinformed about effective 
intervention strategies for cases of bullying and 
harassment. For example, peer mediation and 
conflict resolution strategies, in which students 
speak to each other about an incident, are only 
effective in situations where conflict is among 
students with equal social power. Peer mediation 
that emphasizes that all involved parties contribute 
to conflict can be ineffective, and, at worst, may 
re-victimize the targeted student when there is  
an imbalance of power between the perpetrator  
and the victim. When harassment is bias-based,  
as is the case with anti-LGBTQ+ harassment,  
there is almost always, by definition, an imbalance  
of power.81

School personnel are charged with providing a 
safe learning environment for all students. In this 
survey, the most common reason students gave 
for not reporting harassment or assault was the 
belief that nothing would be done by school staff. 
And as discussed above, even when students did 
report incidents of victimization, the most common 
staff responses were to do nothing or merely to 
tell the student to ignore it. By not effectively 
addressing harassment and assault, students who 
are victimized are denied an adequate opportunity 
to learn. It is particularly troubling that 16.0% of 
victimized students were told by school staff to 
change their behavior for reasons such as their 
sexual orientation or gender expression (see Table 
1.2), which implies that they somehow brought 
the problem upon themselves for simply being who 
they are. This type of response by school staff may 
exacerbate an already hostile school climate for 
LGBTQ+ students, and may deter students from 
reporting other incidents of harassment or assault 
in the future. 

Considering that many students attended school 
online, for the whole year or for part of the year, 
and that students may continue to attend school 

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYin online or hybrid learning environments, it is 
important to consider our findings that students 
who attended school online at any point in the year 
were less likely to report harassment and assault to 
staff than were students who attended school only 
in-person. Schools that provide online instruction 
should work to ensure that their procedures for 

reporting incidents of victimization are clear to 
students. Additionally, staff in such settings may 
need to develop methods for students to approach 
them about harassment and assault and ensure 
that students understand they are accessible, even 
in a virtual manner. 

31

EXPERIENCES OF ANTI-LGBTQ+ DISCRIMINATION  
AT SCHOOL

LGBTQ+ students may experience discriminatory 
school policies and practices that are related 
to their actual or perceived LGBTQ+ identities. 
Examples of policies and practices that LGBTQ+ 
students might experience in their schools include 
restricting LGBTQ+ expression, being prevented 
from using or accessing facilities aligned with 
one’s gender, being disciplined for activities 
that are not disciplined when it does not involve 
LGBTQ+ students, and being limited or excluded 
from activities due to their LGBTQ+ identities. 
Such policies and practices may disrupt LGBTQ+ 
students’ school experiences and may contribute 
to overall negative school experiences for 
LGBTQ+ students and make them feel as if they 
are not valued, or even allowed, in their school 
communities.

Experiences of Discriminatory School Policies 
and Practices

Overall, the majority of students in our survey 
had personally experienced a number of specific 
LGBTQ+-related discriminatory policies and 
practices at their school — nearly 6 in 10 students 
(58.9%) indicated that they had experienced at 
least one of such LGBTQ+-related discriminatory 
policies and practices (see Figure 1.29). Notably, 
LGBTQ+ students had different experiences with 
discriminatory policies and practices depending on 
their learning environment. LGBTQ+ students who 
had been only in in-person learning environments 
during the academic years were far more likely 
to experience any form of LGBTQ+-related 
discrimination than those in the other types of 
learning environments.82

Some of the most common discriminatory policies 
and practices experienced by LGBTQ+ students 
where those that targeted students’ gender, 
potentially limiting their ability to make gender-
affirming choices and negatively impacting their 
school experience:83 

• 29.2% had been prevented from using their 
chosen name or pronouns in their schools;

• 27.2% had been prevented from using the 
bathroom that aligned with their gender;

• 23.8% had been prevented from using the 
locker room that aligned with their gender; 

• 20.6% had been prevented from wearing 
clothes deemed “inappropriate” based on 
gender; and

• 16.0% had been prevented from playing on 
the sports team that is consistent with their 
gender.

It is important to note that each of these gender-
related discriminatory policies and practices 
explicitly target and limit students’ gender identity 
and expression, and thus, may uniquely impact 
transgender and nonbinary students. For further 
discussion on the experiences of transgender and 
nonbinary students and their experiences with 
discriminatory policies and practices at school,  
see the “School Climate and Gender” section of  
Part Three in this report.

Many LGBTQ+ students in our survey also 
indicated that some schools maintain policies 
and practices that targeted or limited their self-
expression of being LGBTQ+ (see also Figure 
1.29):

• 25.2% of LGBTQ+ students were disciplined 

for public affection, such as kissing or holding 
hands, that is not similarly disciplined among 
non-LGBTQ+ students;

• 15.6% of LGBTQ+ students were prevented 
from writing about or doing school projects 
about LGBTQ+ issues; and

• 12.3% of LGBTQ+ students were prevented 
from wearing clothing supporting LGBTQ+ 
issues.

In addition, many of the LGBTQ+ students in our 
survey indicated that their extracurricular activities 
were limited or restricted by school discriminatory 
policies or practices:

• 16.6% of LGBTQ+ students were prevented 

from writing or talking about LGBTQ+ issues in 
extracurricular activities;

32

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY• 12.3% of LGBTQ+ were prevented from 

forming or promoting a GSA; and

• 11.3% of LGBTQ+ students shared that school 
staff or coaches had prevented or discouraged 
them from playing sports because they 
identified as LGBTQ+.

Clearly, some schools are sending the message 
that LGBTQ+ topics, and in some cases, even 
LGBTQ+ people themselves, are not appropriate 

for school. Discriminatory policies and practices 
negatively impact LGBTQ+ students and prevent 
LGBTQ+ students from participating in the 
school community as fully and completely as 
other students (see the Hostile School Climate: 
Educational Outcomes and Psychological Well-
Being section of this report). In order to ensure 
that schools are welcoming and affirming of 
all students, staff and administration should 
eliminate policies and practices that target, or 
disproportionately impact, LGBTQ+ students.

HOSTILE SCHOOL CLIMATE: EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES  
AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING

School Climate and Educational Outcomes

Educational Aspirations. In order to examine 
the relationship between school climate and 
educational outcomes, we asked students about 
their aspirations with regard to further education, 
including their plans to complete high school 
and their highest level of expected educational 
attainment.

Plans to Graduate High School. The vast majority 
of LGBTQ+ students in our survey (93.8%) 
planned to graduate high school; however, 5.3% 
were not sure if they would graduate and 0.9% did 
not plan to graduate. We also found that LGBTQ+ 
students in earlier grades were more likely than 
their older peers to indicate that they were unsure 
about their high school graduation plans.84 Further, 
it is important to note that the 2021 NSCS only 
included students who were in school at some 
point during the 2020–2021 school year and does 
not include youth who had already left school 
before the school year began.

We also asked LGBTQ+ students who did not plan 
on completing high school or who were not sure 
if they would graduate whether they planned to 
obtain a General Education Diploma (GED) or 
similar equivalent. The majority of these students 
(72.3%) were not sure if they would obtain a 
GED, 21.4% indicated that they planned to and 
6.2% indicated that they did not. Some research 
on high school equivalency certification in the 
general student population suggests that GED 
equivalencies are not associated with the same 
educational attainment and earning potential as 
high school diplomas.85 Nevertheless, the majority 
of students who planned to get a GED (58.3%) 
indicated that they intended to pursue some type 
of post-secondary education.86 More research 
is needed to better understand how LGBTQ+ 
students’ educational and career plans may be 
impeded if they do not graduate from high school.

Reasons LGBTQ+ Students May Not Finish High 
School. We asked those students who indicated 
they were not planning on completing high school 
or were not sure if they would graduate about 
their reasons for leaving school. Most of these 
students cited multiple reasons for potentially 

not graduating. As shown in Table 1.3, the vast 
majority of these students reported reasons related 
to mental health, such as depression, anxiety, 
or stress (92.3% of those who provided reasons 
for leaving high school), and two-thirds (65.5%) 
reported academic reasons, including poor grades, 
high number of absences, or not having enough 
credits to graduate. About half of these students 
cited reasons related to a hostile school climate 
(51.5%), including issues with harassment, 
unsupportive peers or educators, and gendered 
school policies/practices, such as restrictions 
on which bathroom they are allowed to use. In 
addition, about half mentioned reasons related to 
COVID (49.5%).

LGBTQ+ students may consider leaving school for 
many reasons, some of which may have little to 
do with their sexual orientation, gender identity, 
or peer victimization — as noted above. However, 
it is also possible that some of the mental health 
and academic concerns that students reported 
were caused by experiences of a hostile school 
environment, as noted later in this section. 
For example, school-based victimization may 
impact students’ mental health,87 and this 
lower psychological well-being may also place 
students at risk for lower academic achievement.88 
Furthermore, a lack of safety may lead to students 
missing school, which can result in a student 
being pushed out of school by school disciplinary 
or criminal sanctions for truancy,89 dropping out of 
school as a result of poor academic achievement, 
or disengaging with school due to the days missed. 

Post-Secondary Aspirations. When asked about 
their aspirations with regard to post-secondary 
education, as shown in Figure 1.30, LGBTQ+ 
students most commonly planned on obtaining a 
Bachelor’s degree (41.1%), followed by a graduate 
degree, e.g., Master’s degree, PhD, or MD (33.9%). 
Only 11.8% of LGBTQ+ students indicated that 
they did not plan to pursue any type of post-
secondary education (i.e., that they only planned to 
obtain a high school diploma, did not plan to finish 
high school, or were unsure of their plans). 

School Climate and Educational Aspirations. 
Experiencing victimization related to one’s sexual 
orientation, gender expression, or gender during 

34

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYthe school day can negatively affect an LGBTQ+ 
student’s interest in pursuing further education. As 
shown in Figure 1.31, among those who attended 
school in-person either full-time or combined with 
online instruction, LGBTQ+ students who reported 
higher levels of in-person victimization regarding 
their sexual orientation were nearly twice as likely 
to report that did not plan on pursuing their 
education beyond high school (16.6% vs. 9.4%), 
and LGBTQ+ students reporting higher levels of 
victimization based on gender expression or gender 
were twice as likely (18.3% vs. 8.8% and 18.1% 
vs. 9.0%, respectively). 90 Among those LGBTQ+ 
students who attended school online either full-
time or combined with in-person instruction, as 
shown in Figure 1.32, students who experienced 
online anti-LGBTQ+ harassment during school or 
from students at their school were nearly twice 
as likely to report not wanting to pursue their 
education beyond high school. For example, 
11.6% of LGBTQ+ students who experienced 
lower levels of harassment online related to their 
sexual orientation did not plan on further education 

compared to 18.7% of those who experienced 
higher levels.91 Anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory 
policies and practices were also related to lower 
educational aspirations for LGBTQ+ students in our 
survey — 13.7% of students who had experienced 
this type of discrimination at school did not plan 
on continuing their education compared to 9.2% of 
those who had not.92

School Climate and Academic Achievement. A 
hostile school climate may also negatively affect 
an LGBTQ+ student’s academic performance. As 
shown in Table 1.4, LGBTQ+ students who had 
higher levels of in-person and online victimization 
based on their sexual orientation, gender 
expression, or gender had significantly lower GPAs 
than students who experienced less harassment 
and assault. For example, LGBTQ+ students who 
experienced higher levels of victimization based 
on gender expression reported an average GPA

illustrated in Table 1.4, experiences of institutional 
discrimination were also related to lower 
educational achievement.94

Overall, the vast majority of LGBTQ+ students 
planned to complete high school as well as some 
form of post-secondary education, although 
experiences with anti-LGBTQ+ harassment and 
discrimination were both associated with lower 
educational aspirations as well as lower GPA. Thus, 
supporting LGBTQ+ students’ future educational 
attainment requires focused efforts that reduce 
anti-LGBTQ+ bias in schools and create affirming 
academic environments. Further, these efforts must 
be implemented at all grade levels, with particular 
attention paid to younger students, who may be at 
greater risk for not completing high school.

School Climate and Absenteeism. School-based 
victimization can impinge on a student’s right to 
an education. Students who are regularly harassed 
or assaulted during the school day may attempt to 
avoid these hurtful experiences by not attending 
school and, accordingly, may be more likely to 
miss school than students who do not experience 
such victimization. We found that experiences 
of both in-person and online victimization were, 
in fact, related to missing days of school. As 
shown in Figures 1.33 and 1.34, higher levels 
of in-person victimization and higher levels of 
online victimization in school regarding sexual 
orientation, gender expression and gender were 
both associated with more than a two times greater 
likelihood of missing school in the past month for 
LGBTQ+ students.95 Experiencing anti-LGBTQ+ 
discrimination at school was also related to 
missing days of school — LGBTQ+ students who 
experienced this type of discrimination at school 
were nearly three times likelier to have missed 
school in the past month because they felt unsafe 
or uncomfortable than those who had not (43.3% 
vs. 16.4%).96

As these findings indicate, both negative 
interpersonal experiences, such as victimization, 
as well as negative institutional treatment, such 
as anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory policies and 
practices contribute to a school setting that 
feels unwelcoming for many LGBTQ+ students. 
And as such, they restrict access to an LGBTQ+ 
student’s education. Although LGBTQ+ students 
reported a lower incidence of online victimization

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYrelated to their LGBTQ+ identities than in-person 
victimization, as discussed previously in this 
section of the report, the effects of the two forms 
of victimization were very similar on educational 
outcomes.

School Climate and School Discipline 

The use of harsh and exclusionary discipline, 
such as zero tolerance policies, has proliferated 
over the previous several decades for both serious 
infractions as well as minor violations of school 
policies.97 Initially framed as vital for protecting 
teachers and students,98 these disciplinary policies 
are regarded by many as being over-employed 

in removing students from the traditional school 
environment.99 The use of harsh discipline 
has contributed to higher dropout rates, as 
well as more youth in alternative educational 
settings and in juvenile justice facilities, where 
educational supports and opportunities may be 
less available.100 Growing awareness of the soaring 
use of exclusionary school discipline approaches 
in the U.S. has included some attention to their 
effect on LGBTQ+ youth.101 It is possible that both 
the high rates of peer victimization and the school 
policies that, intentionally or unintentionally, target 
LGBTQ+ students may put these students at risk of 
greater contact with school authorities and increase 
their likelihood of facing disciplinary sanctions.

Rates of School Discipline. More than a third 
(40.7%) of students in this survey reported having 
ever been disciplined at school, with most of 
these students reporting discipline that occurred 
in-school, such as being sent to principal’s office, 
being isolated alone in a classroom or hallway, and 
receiving detention (see Figure 1.35). A smaller 
portion of LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing 
disciplinary consequences that prohibited them 
from attending school, such as out-of-school 
suspension and expulsion (see also Figure 1.35).

There were no differences by type of learning 
environment in the likelihood of experiencing 
any school discipline. However, there are certain 
forms of discipline that were specific to an online 
learning environment. Some LGBTQ+ students 
who had been in online learning environments, 
either online only or hybrid settings, experienced 

discipline in the form of restrictions from online 
participation in class. As also shown in Figure 
1.35, 7.8% reported that they had had their online 
participation restricted and 5.4% said they had 
been removed from the online classroom. 

Disciplinary action in school can lead to having 
contact with the criminal or juvenile justice 
system, such as being arrested or serving time in a 
detention facility. A very small portion of LGBTQ+ 
students (1.1%) reported having had contact 
with the criminal or juvenile justice system. 
It is important to note that we asked students 
specifically about justice system involvement as 
a result of school discipline, and thus the finding 
does not reflect student involvement in criminal or 
juvenile justice system in general.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYand discriminatory policies that intentionally or 
unintentionally target LGBTQ+ students, may put 
them in greater contact with school authorities and 
increase their risk of discipline. For these reasons, 
we examine whether students who experienced 
victimization and discrimination experienced 
higher rates of school discipline. 

Discipline Due to Punitive Response to Harassment 
and Assault. As discussed in the Reporting of 
School-Based Harassment and Assault section, 
some LGBTQ+ students reported that they 
themselves were disciplined when they reported 
being victimized to school staff. As a result, 
LGBTQ+ students who experience higher rates 
of victimization may also experience higher rates 
of school discipline, perhaps because they were 
perceived to be the perpetrator in these incidents. 
Indeed, LGBTQ+ youth who reported higher than 

average levels of victimization based on their 
sexual orientation or gender expression experienced 
substantially greater rates of discipline examined 
in this survey.102 As shown in Figures 1.36 and 
1.37, the relationship between victimization and 
discipline was similar whether it was in-person 
or online. For example, among those LGBTQ+ 
students who were in an in-person school 
environment at any point in the 2020–2021 
academic year, 61.1% of students with higher 
levels of in-person victimization based on sexual 
orientation experienced school discipline compared 
to 33.6% of students with lower levels of this 
type of victimization. For those who were in an 
online school environment, 68.5% of students who 
experienced online victimization based on sexual 
orientation more frequently experienced school 
discipline compared to 38.9% who experienced it 
less frequently.

Discipline Due to Missing School. LGBTQ+ students 
who are victimized at school may also miss 
school because they feel unsafe, and thus, face 
potential disciplinary consequences for truancy. 
We found that students who reported missing 
school due to safety concerns were more likely to 
have experienced school discipline.103 Specifically, 
55.9% of students who had missed at least a day 
of school in past month because they felt unsafe or 
uncomfortable had faced some sort of disciplinary 
action, compared to 33.5% of students who had not 
missed school for these reasons.

Discipline Due to Discriminatory Policies and 
Practices. As discussed in the Experiences of 
Discrimination section of this report, some schools 
have official policies or unofficial practices that 
unfairly target LGBTQ+ youth, and also put 
LGBTQ+ youth at greater risk for school discipline. 
For example, having a gendered dress code may 

result in a transgender or nonbinary student being 
disciplined because they are wearing clothing 
deemed “inappropriate” based on their legal sex. 
Furthermore, as also indicated in that earlier 
section, a number of students in our survey 
reported that they were subjected to punishment 
for violations that were not similarly punished 
among their non-LGBTQ+ peers (e.g., same-sex 
couples experiencing harsher discipline for public 
displays of affection in schools than heterosexual 
couples). When we examined the relationship 
between discrimination and discipline, we found 
that LGBTQ+ students who had experienced 
discriminatory policies and practices at school had 
reported higher rates of school discipline — 51.2% 
of LGBTQ+ youth experiencing discrimination at 
school had experienced some form of disciplinary 
action, compared to 26.2% of youth who had not 
experienced discrimination.104

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYThese findings evidence that a sizeable number of 
LGBTQ+ students experienced school discipline, 
and that experiences of victimization regarding 
sexual orientation, gender expression or gender, as 
well as discriminatory school policies and practices, 
may contribute to higher rates of school discipline. 
In order to reduce disciplinary disparities toward 
LGBTQ+ students, schools need to employ non-
punitive discipline practices and the creation of 
safe and affirming spaces for LGBTQ+ students, 
with properly trained school personnel. Educators 
need to be provided professional development 
trainings on issues specifically related to LGBTQ+ 
student and bias-based bullying and harassment, 
so that they can effectively intervene in cases of 
bullying of LGBTQ+ students. In addition, schools 
need to eliminate school policies and practices that 
discriminate against LGBTQ+ students. 

School Climate and School Belonging

The degree to which students feel accepted by 
and a part of their school community is another 
important indicator of school climate and is 
related to a number of educational outcomes, 
including greater academic motivation and effort 
and higher academic achievement.105 As a result 
of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and discrimination 
in school, LGBTQ+ students may have a lower 
sense of attachment or belonging to their school 
community. Indeed, we found that LGBTQ+ 
students who experienced a higher severity of in-
person victimization based on sexual orientation or 
gender expression at school reported lower levels 
of school belonging than students who experienced 
less severe victimization in school.106 For example, 
as shown in Figure 1.38, more than half (61.0%) 

of students who experienced lower levels of 
victimization based on their sexual orientation 
reported a positive sense of connection to their 
school, compared to a quarter (26.9%) of students 
who experienced more severe victimization. 
Similarly, among LGBTQ+ students who were in 
school online during the academic year, online 
victimization related to sexual orientation, gender 
expression, or gender was also related to a lower 
sense of belonging at school.107 As shown in 
Figure 1.39, for example, 55.2% of LGBTQ+ 
students who experienced lower levels of online 
victimization based on their sexual orientation 
reported positive school belonging compared to 
17.3% of those who experienced higher levels.

Experiencing anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory 
policies and practices at school was also related 
to decreased feelings of connectedness to the 
school community. LGBTQ+ students who did not 
experience school-based discrimination were more 
likely to report positive feelings of school belonging 
compared to students who had experienced school-
based discrimination (72.5% vs. 36.7%).108 

School Climate and Psychological  
Well-Being

Previous research has shown that being harassed 
or assaulted at school may have a negative impact 
on students’ mental health and self-esteem,109 
which may be even more of a concern for LGBTQ+ 
students given that that they face an increased 
likelihood for experiencing harassment and assault 
in school.110 To this end, we examined self-
esteem111 and depression and their relationship 
to in-person and online victimization at school.112

Previous research has also shown that LGBTQ+ 
youth are at higher risk for suicidal ideation, and 
that bullying in school contributes to this risk.113 
Thus, we also examine the relationship between 
victimization and suicidality among these students.

LGBTQ+ students who reported more severe 
in-person victimization at school regarding their 
sexual orientation, gender expression, or gender:

• had lower levels of self-esteem than those who 
reported less severe victimization of this type 
(see Figure 1.40); 114

• had higher levels of depression than those who 
reported less severe victimization of this type 
(see Figure 1.41);115 and

• were more than two times likelier to have 
seriously considered suicide in the past 
year than those who reported less severe 
victimization of this type.116

LGBTQ+ students who reported online victimization 
at school regarding their sexual orientation, gender 
expression, or gender occurring often or frequently:

• had lower levels of self-esteem than those who 
reported online victimization less often (see 
Figure 1.42);117 

• had higher levels of depression than those who 
reported online victimization less often (see 
Figure 1.43);118 and

Discrimination and stigma have also been found 
to adversely affect the well-being of LGBTQ+ 
people.120 We found that LGBTQ+ students in our 
survey who reported experiencing anti-LGBTQ+

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYConclusions

The findings in this section provide insight into how 
peer victimization and institutional discrimination 
may lead to less welcoming schools and more 
negative educational outcomes for LGBTQ+ 
students. LGBTQ+ students who experienced 
victimization and discrimination were more likely 
to have lower educational aspirations, lower grades, 
and higher absenteeism. They were also more 
likely to experience school discipline, which could 
result in pushing students out of school, and even 
into the criminal justice system.124 These findings 
also demonstrate that a hostile school climate 

may negatively impact an LGBTQ+ student’s 
sense of school belonging and psychological well-
being. In order to ensure that LGBTQ+ students 
are afforded supportive learning environments 
and equal educational opportunities, community 
and school advocates must work to prevent and 
respond to in-school victimization and to eliminate 
school policies and practices that discriminate 
against LGBTQ+ youth. Reducing victimization and 
discrimination in school may then lead to better 
mental health for LGBTQ+ youth, better enabling 
them to reach their fullest potential inside and 
outside of school.

PART TWO: 
SCHOOL-BASED 
RESOURCES AND 
SUPPORTS

AVAILABILITY OF SCHOOL-BASED RESOURCES AND 
SUPPORTS 

The availability of resources and supports in 
school for LGBTQ+ students is another important 
dimension of school climate. There are several key 
resources that may help to promote a safer climate 
and more positive school experiences for students: 
1) student clubs that address issues for LGBTQ+ 
students, 2) school personnel who are supportive of 
LGBTQ+ students, 3) LGBTQ+-inclusive curricular 
materials, and 4) inclusive, supportive school 
policies, such as inclusive anti-bullying policies 
and policies supporting transgender and nonbinary 
students.125 Thus, we examined the availability 
of these resources and supports among LGBTQ+ 
students in the survey.

Supportive Student Clubs

For all students, including LGBTQ+ students, 
participation in extracurricular activities is 
related to a number of positive outcomes, such 
as academic achievement and greater school 
engagement.126 Supportive student clubs for 
LGBTQ+ students, often known as Gay-Straight 
Alliances or Gender and Sexuality Alliances 
(GSAs), can provide LGBTQ+ students in particular 
with a safe and affirming space within a school 
environment that they may otherwise experience 
as hostile.127 GSAs may also provide leadership 
opportunities for students and potential avenues 
for creating positive school change.128 In our 
survey, only a third of LGBTQ+ students (34.8%) 
reported that their school had an active GSA or 
similar student club available during the school 
year. Notably, 17.9% of students reported that 
they ordinarily would have a GSA, however, it 
was unable to meet this year, possibly because of 
disruptions related to COVID-19. Among students 
with a GSA in their school, about half (47.8%) 
of LGBTQ+ students reported they attended GSA 
meetings, and about a quarter (26.9%) said that 
they regularly attended meetings (“often” or 
“frequently”). In addition, about a quarter (24.6%) 
had participated as a leader or an officer in their 
club (see Table 2.1). 

GSA availability differed by learning environment. 
LGBTQ+ students who attended school in-person 
only were less likely to have a GSA available than 
those who attended online only and those who 
attended both in-person and online (26.5% vs. 

36.8% and 35.6%, respectively).129 However, as 
discussed in the Methods section of this report, 
the type of learning environment vis-à-vis online 
versus in-person instruction varied by school 
characteristics, i.e., school type, region, and locale. 
Given that school characteristics have historically 
been related to the availability of LGBTQ+ school 
supports,130 it is possible that these differences 
in the availability of GSAs were related to school 
characteristics. In fact, when we took these into 
account, there were no differences across the three 
types of learning environments in the availability 
of GSAs.131 However, LGBTQ+ students in online-
only learning environments were less likely to 
participate in their GSA than LGBTQ+ students 
in the other two types of learning environments, 
even after considering school characteristics.132 It 
may be that when schools transitioned to online 
formats, they continued to find ways for student 
clubs, such as GSAs, to continue to meet, but 
students may be less inclined to attend student 
clubs meetings online rather than in-person.

There is a small body of research examining why 
LGBTQ+ students may or may not participate in 
their school’s GSA. Our GSA study found that the 
main reasons students do not participate include

Inclusive Curricular Resources

LGBTQ+ student experiences may also be shaped 
by inclusion of LGBTQ+-related information in the 
curriculum. Learning about LGBTQ+ historical 
events and positive role models may enhance 
LGBTQ+ students’ engagement in their schools and 
provide valuable information about the LGBTQ+ 
community. Students in our survey were asked 
whether they had been exposed to representations 
of LGBTQ+ people, history, or events in lessons at 
school, and the majority of respondents (71.6%) 
reported that their classes did not include these 
topics (see Figure 2.1). 

Access to LGBTQ+ Instruction. Of the 28.4% of 
students who indicated that LGBTQ+ topics had 
been discussed in one or more of their classes, 
49.5% said that they were covered in a positive 
manner only, 43.0% said that they were covered 
in a negative manner only, and 7.6% said that 
they were covered both in a positive and negative 
manner. Overall, considering all students in our 
sample, only 16.2% of students received any 
instruction that included positive representations 
of LGBTQ+ people, issues, and topics. Among 
the students who had been taught positive things 
about LGBTQ+-related topics in class, History/
Social Studies and English were the classes most 
often mentioned as being inclusive of these topics 
(see Table 2.2).

Access to inclusive education varied by learning 
environment.135 Students who attended school 
online, either hybrid or only online, were more 
likely to report that LGBTQ+ topics had been 
discussed in a positive way in one or more of their 
classes than were students who attended school 
only in person. Further, students who attended 
school only in person were the most likely to report 
that LGBTQ+ topics had been taught in a negative 
way, even when accounting for school differences 
including region, locale, and school type (religious, 
private, or public). We are unsure as to why these 
differences exist, and there is a need for future 
research to explore the effects of different learning 
environments on positive LGBTQ+ curricular 
inclusion. It is possible that there is something 
about the nature of online instruction that is more 
conducive to LGBTQ+ curriculum. 

Access to LGBTQ+ Inclusive Materials and 
Resources Outside of Classroom Instruction 

Beyond what students are taught in class, it can be 
beneficial for LGBTQ+ students to have access to 
LGBTQ+ content in educational materials that are 
not necessarily covered by classroom instruction. 
For example, students may benefit from textbooks 
that include information about LGBTQ+ people, 
history, or events. Even if their teacher does not 
directly cover this material, these students can still 
access this LGBTQ+ content in their textbook on 
their own time. We asked students about access 
to LGBTQ+ inclusive material and information in 
school outside of direct classroom instruction, such 
as in textbooks or in library materials.136 Under a 
fifth of LGBTQ+ students reported that LGBTQ+-
related topics were included in textbooks or other

reporting that these topics were included in many 
of their textbooks and readings and 16.1% of 
students reporting that they were included in only 
a few.137 Additionally, we asked students about 
their ability to access information about LGBTQ+ 
issues that may not be directly covered in class or 
assigned readings, such as information available 
in school libraries or via school computers. Many 
LGBTQ+ students in our survey did not have 
access to these types of LGBTQ+-related curricular 
resources. As Figure 2.2 illustrates, four in ten 
students who attended school in person reported 
that they could find books or information on 
LGBTQ+-related topics, such as LGBTQ+ history, in 
their school library (7.2% of students reported they 
could find many resources, and 35.6% reported 
they could find only a few.)138 In addition, around 
half (48.2%) of students who attended school in 
person and had internet access at school reported 
being able to access LGBTQ+-related information 
via school computers.

Students in different learning environments had 
varying levels of access to LGBTQ+ materials and 
resources. Similar to our findings about LGBTQ+ 
instruction, students who attended school only in 
person reported having fewer LGBTQ+ textbooks 
or other assigned reading than students who 
attended hybrid or online-only school.139 However, 
among students who attended school in-person 

for any time in the school year, rates of access 
to LGBTQ+ inclusive materials in school libraries 
and via school internet were similar between those 
who were in online only learning environments and 
those in hybrid learning environments.140

Access to LGBTQ+ Sex Education. In addition 
to asking broadly about LGBTQ+ inclusion in 
students’ classes in the past year, we also asked 
students specifically about any LGBTQ+-inclusion 
in sex education teaching or classes they had 
ever received in school. Sex education can be 
a prime location for LGBTQ+ inclusion and an 
important source of information for youth about a 
variety of critical topics — including contraception 
and pregnancy, HIV/AIDS and other sexually 
transmitted infections (STIs), dating and marriage, 
sexual violence, and puberty. Sex education is 
often included in health classes, and as previously 
discussed, 20.6% of LGBTQ+ youth reported 
that they were taught positive representations of 
LGBTQ+ topics in their health classes. However, we 
wanted to specifically examine LGBTQ+ inclusion 
in sex education that occurs in school, both in and 
out of health classes. 

Less than a third (29.6%) of students who 
received some kind of sex education reported 
that it positively included LGBTQ+ topics in some 
way. When considering all students in the sample, 
including those who did not receive sex education,

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYonly 7.4% received LGBTQ+ sex education, which 
included positive representations of both LGB and 
transgender and nonbinary topics (see Figure 2.3). 
Students more commonly reported that their sexual 
education courses positively covered LGB topics 
but not transgender and nonbinary topics (4.2%) 
than that their courses including transgender and 
nonbinary topics but not LGB topics (1.2%).141 
Regarding learning environment, students who 
attended school online, either in online only or 
hybrid learning environments, were more likely 
to report receiving any kind of sex education, 
and LGBTQ+ inclusive sex education, than were 
students who attended school only in person.142

Supportive School Personnel

Supportive teachers, principals, and other school 
staff serve as another important resource for 
LGBTQ+ students. Being able to speak with a 
caring adult in school may have a significant 
positive impact on school experiences for students, 
particularly those who feel marginalized or 
experience harassment. 

Number of Supportive School Personnel. In our 
survey, almost all students (96.3%) could identify 
at least one school staff member whom they 
believed was supportive of LGBTQ+ students at 
their school, and more than half (58.2%) could 
identify six or more supportive school staff (see 
Figure 2.4). However, there were significant 
differences in the number of supportive school 
staff by type of school environment.143 Those 
students who were in online learning environments 
for the entire school year reported a higher 
number of supportive educators than those in 

hybrid online and in-person learning environments 
and those who were only in in-person learning 
environments. Further, LGBTQ+ students who were 
in school only in-person during the year reported 
the fewest number of supportive educators. Given 
that school characteristics have historically been 
related to school climate for LGBTQ+ students 
and given that the type of learning environment 
was related to school characteristics (see the 
Methods section of this report), it is possible that 
school characteristics could be a factor in LGBTQ+ 
student reports on supportive school personnel. 
However, these differences by learning environment 
were consistent even when school characteristics 
were accounted for.

Supportive School Administration. As the leaders 
of the school, school administrators have a 
particularly important role to play in the school 
experiences of LGBTQ+ youth. They may serve 
not only as caring adults to whom the youth can 
turn, but they also set the tone of the school and 
determine specific policies and programs that 
may affect the school’s climate. As shown in 
Figure 2.5, 36.6% of LGBTQ+ students reported 
that their school administration (e.g., principal, 
vice principal) was very or somewhat supportive 
of LGBTQ+ students, and less than a quarter of 
students (23.7%) said their administration was 
very or somewhat unsupportive. It is also important 
to note that over a third of students (39.7%) 
indicated that their administration was neutral. 
This may signify administration that has not been 
actively supportive or unsupportive regarding 
LGBTQ+ students. It may also signify that students 
are unsure of their administration’s stance on 
LGBTQ+ issues, perhaps because they have not

these differences were maintained even when we 
considered school characteristics.

There were also significant differences by type of 
learning environment in the perceptions of school 
administration support for LGBTQ+ students.144 
Similar to our findings regarding supportive school 
personnel, LGBTQ+ students who were in in-
person instruction for all of the school year were 
less likely to report that their administration was 
supportive. However, there were no differences 
between those in online only instruction and those 
in hybrid online/in-person environments. Further, 

Comfort Talking to School Personnel about 
LGBTQ+ Issues. To understand whether certain 
types of educators were more likely to be seen 
as supportive, we asked LGBTQ+ students how 
comfortable they would feel talking one-on-one 
with various school personnel about LGBTQ+-
related issues. As shown in Figure 2.6, students 
reported that they would feel most comfortable 
talking with school-based mental health

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYprofessionals (e.g., school counselors, social 
workers, or psychologists) and teachers: 51.8% 
said they would be somewhat or very comfortable 
talking about LGBTQ+ issues with school-based 
mental health professionals and 41.8% would 
be somewhat or very comfortable talking with a 
teacher. Fewer students indicated that they would 
feel comfortable talking one-on-one with a school 
librarian (30.7%) or a school nurse (28.1%) 
about these issues. LGBTQ+ students were least 
likely to feel comfortable talking with a school 
security officer or school athletic coach or Physical 
Education (P.E.) teacher about LGBTQ+ issues (see 
also Figure 2.6).145

Similar to our findings regarding supportive school 
personnel and supportive administration, LGBTQ+ 
students who were in in-person instruction for all 
of the school year reported lower level levels of 
comfort for all types of school personnel compared 
to those who were in online instruction for the 
entire year and those who were in hybrid online 
and in-person school environments.146 However, 
when we took into account region, locale and type 
of school, the only differences remained were 
with regard to school mental health professionals, 
school nurses, and school librarians.147 LGBTQ+ 
students who had been in both online and in-
person learning during the academic year had 
a higher level of comfort talking with school 
mental health professionals than other students, 
and LGBTQ+ students who had had in-person 
instruction the entire academic year had the lowest 
level of comfort with school nurses and with school 
librarians than other students.

Experiences with School Security Personnel. As 
discussed above, the vast majority of LGBTQ+ 
students would not feel comfortable speaking 
with school security personnel about LGBTQ+ 
issues. Most students (82.9%) reported having a 
security personnel at school. As shown in Figure 
2.7, more than a quarter (30.8%) felt safe at 
school because of their presence, and a smaller 
percentage (25.1%) felt unsafe because of their 
presence.148 However, for nearly half of LGBTQ+ 
students (44.0%), the presence of school security 
had no effect on their feelings of safety at school. 
Further, as shown in Figure 2.8, the vast majority 
of LGBTQ+ students in the survey had little or no 
interaction with these personnel (80.1% reporting 
“never” or “rarely”). Half (51.2%) of those who 
had had any interaction with security personnel 
at school described the interactions as neither 
positive or negative, and only about a tenth 
(12.4%) reported that the interactions had been 
somewhat or very negative (see also Figure 2.8).

Overall, the type of learning environment that 
LGBTQ+ students had during the 2020–2021 
academic year as a result of COVID may have 
affected their ability to find and seek out educators 
and school staff as supports. LGBTQ+ students 
who were in in-person instruction reported fewer 
supportive school personnel and rated their 
school administration as less supportive. Although 
we might have hypothesized that students who 
regularly saw school personnel in-person might 
have greater opportunities to find support from 
adults in their school, many schools who had in-
person instruction may have had restrictions on 
how much time students could spend outside of 
classroom instruction, such as in extracurricular 
activities, interacting with school personnel. In 
such cases, these students may then not see these 
adults as supportive as they might have had they 
had more opportunities for interaction. It is also 
interesting to note that the level of comfort of 
talking to school personnel about LGBTQ+ issues 
varied by learning environment only for school 
mental health professionals, librarians, and nurses, 
who are all non-instructional staff. It is possible 
that students who were in full-time or partial online 
learning during the year had few opportunities to 
interact with these staff and may be basing their 
comfort level on past experiences or may have had 
no or few current opportunities to have positive or 
negative experiences with these persons, which 
may have affected their feelings of comfort talking 
to them.

Visible Support. Supportive teachers and other 
school staff members serve an important function 
in the lives of LGBTQ+ youth, helping them feel 
safer in school, as well as promoting their sense of 
school belonging and psychological well-being. One 
way that educators can demonstrate their support 
for LGBTQ+ youth is through visible displays of 
such support, such as Safe Space stickers and 
posters. These stickers and posters are part of 
GLSEN’s Safe Space Kit,149 an educator resource 
aimed at making learning environments more 
positive for LGBTQ+ students. These materials are 
intended to help students identify staff members 
who are allies to LGBTQ+ students and who can 
be a source of support or needed intervention. 
We asked students if they had seen Safe Space 
stickers or posters displayed in their school, and 
more than half of LGBTQ+ students (51.9%) 
in the survey reported seeing these materials 
at their school. LGBTQ+ students who were in 
hybrid learning environments were most likely and 
students in online-only learning environments were 
least likely to see these visible signs of supports 
at school. This pattern of difference held even 
after controlling for school characteristics.150 
Those students who were never inside a school 
building during the year would not have seen a 
physical Safe Space sticker or poster, and although 
educators could display these materials in their 
background, it may be that they were less able or 
less likely to do so. It is not clear why those who 
were in hybrid online/in-person instruction during 
the year were more likely to have seen these visible 
signs of supports compared to those who were 
in in-person instruction only, especially after we 
considered the characteristics of the school.

The presence of LGBTQ+ school personnel who are 
out or open at school about their sexual orientation 
and/or gender identity may provide another source 
of support for LGBTQ+ students. In addition, the 
number of out LGBTQ+ personnel may provide a 
sign of a more supportive and accepting school 
climate. Less than half of students (42.4%) in our 
survey said they could identify at least one  
out LGBTQ+ staff person at their school (see  
Figure 2.9). 

Inclusive and Supportive School Policies

GLSEN believes that all students should 
have access to a safe and supportive learning 
environment, regardless of a student’s sexual 
orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. 
Official school policies and guidelines can 
contribute toward this goal by setting the standards 
for which students should be treated, noting what 
types of behavior are unacceptable, and making 
students aware of the protections and rights 
afforded to them. In this section, we examine the 
availability of two specific forms of supportive 
school policies: inclusive anti-bullying and 
harassment policies and supportive transgender 
and nonbinary student policies.

School Policies for Addressing Bullying, 
Harassment, and Assault. School policies that 
address in-school bullying, harassment, and 
assault are powerful tools for creating school 
environments where students feel safe. These 
types of policies can explicitly state protections 
based on personal characteristics, such as sexual 
orientation and gender identity/expression, 
among others. In this report, we identify and

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYdiscuss three types of school anti-bullying and 
harassment policies: 1) comprehensive, 2) partially 
enumerated, and 3) generic. Comprehensive 
policies explicitly enumerate protections based on 
personal characteristics and include both sexual 
orientation and gender identity/expression. When 
a school has and enforces a comprehensive policy, 
especially one which also includes procedures 
for reporting incidents to school authorities, it 
can send a message that bullying, harassment, 
and assault are unacceptable and will not be 
tolerated. Comprehensive school policies may 
also provide students with greater protection 
against victimization because they make clear 
the various forms of bullying, harassment, and 
assault that will not be tolerated. They may also 
demonstrate that student safety, including the 
safety of LGBTQ+ students, is taken seriously 
by school administrators. Partially enumerated 
policies explicitly mention sexual orientation or 
gender identity/expression, but not both, and 
may not provide the same level of protection for 
LGBTQ+ students. Lastly, generic anti-bullying or 
anti-harassment school policies do not enumerate

sexual orientation or gender identity/expression as 
protected categories.151

Students were asked whether their school had 
a policy about in-school bullying, harassment, 
or assault, and if that policy explicitly included 
sexual orientation and gender identity/expression. 
Although a majority of students (76.1%) reported 
that their school had some type of policy (see Table 
2.3), only 12.0% of students in our survey reported 
that their school had a comprehensive policy that 
specifically mentioned both sexual orientation and 
gender identity/expression (see also Table 2.3).

Although we would not necessarily expect the 
presence of an anti-bullying/harassment policy to 
vary by type of learning environment during the 
2020–2021 academic year, LGBTQ+ students who 
had been in in-person instruction during the entire 
academic year were, in fact, less likely to report 
having a comprehensive policy, and more likely to 
have a generic policy, than students who had been 
only in online instruction, even after accounting for 
school characteristics.152 It is possible that many 
schools revisited or revised their anti-bullying/
harassment policies after they first entered into 
virtual instruction at the end of the 2019–2020 
academic year to address the online learning 
environments, and as a result, many students in 
online-only or hybrid environments were made 
aware of the new or revised policies. 

Policies and Guidelines on Transgender and 
Nonbinary Students. Anti-bullying and harassment 
policies are critical for ensuring safe school 
environments for all students. However, these 
policies do not explicitly address potential 
discrimination faced by LGBTQ+ students. Our 
research has indicated that transgender and 
nonbinary youth are at heightened risk for in-
school discrimination that can greatly hinder their

right to an education (see also the Experiences of 
Discrimination at School section).153 Furthermore, 
during the 2020–2021 school year, many states 
had attempted to introduce legislation that would 
negatively affect the life and school experiences for 
transgender youth.154 Nevertheless, some state and 
local education agencies have developed explicit 
policies and implemented practices designed to 
ensure transgender and nonbinary students are 
provided with equal access to education.155 For 
example, to ensure that transgender and nonbinary 
students are called by the appropriate name and 
pronouns, some schools have adopted policies 
that require those at school to use students’ 
chosen names and pronouns consistent with their 
gender identity. However, little is known about the 
prevalence or the content of these types of policies.

In our survey, we asked LGBTQ+ students whether 
their school or district had official policies or 
guidelines to support transgender and nonbinary 
students, and only 8.5% of all transgender 
students  indicated that their school or district had 
such policies or guidelines (see also Figure 2.10). 
Students whose school reportedly had such a policy 
were asked about specific components of their 
school’s transgender and nonbinary student policy. 
Among transgender and nonbinary students whose 
school had a policy, most students reported that 
these policies commonly addressed use of chosen 
name/pronouns, appropriate bathroom access, and 
updating official school records to reflect name or 
gender change (see Table 2.4). It is important to 
note that the minority of transgender and nonbinary 

students reported having a school policy supporting 
transgender and nonbinary students. Thus, the 
number of transgender and nonbinary students 
who are protected by any of these specific policy 
components would be much smaller. Table 2.4 
also shows the total percentage of these students 
who would be covered. For example, even though 
91.1% of transgender and nonbinary students who 
had a supportive policy at their school reported 
that it addressed use of chosen name or pronouns, 
that equates to only 7.7% of all the transgender 
and nonbinary students in the survey. 

There were differences among the LGBTQ+ 
students in the survey by type of learning 
environment. Those students who had been in 
in-person instruction during the entire academic 
year were less likely to report having an affirming 
policy or guidelines for transgender and nonbinary 
students than students who had been only in 
online instruction and those in hybrid learning 
environments, even after considering school 
characteristics.156 As discussed above, it is 
possible that in schools that transitioned to online 
learning, for either part of the year or for the whole 
year, revised or revisited school policies to adapt to 
this change, making students more aware of school 
policies. It is also possible that those students in 
in-person learning environments were more aware 
of the lack of supports or the restrictions placed 
on transgender and nonbinary students in their 
schools by virtue of being in the school building  
all year.

Conclusions

Overall, the findings in this section on Availability 
of School-Based Resources and Supports revealed 
that many LGBTQ+ students did not have access 
to LGBTQ+ resources and supports at their school. 
Regarding GSAs, over a third reported that they 
did not have this type of club at their school. 
With regard to inclusive curricular resources, the 
majority of students reported that their classes 
did not teach positive representations of LGBTQ+ 
history, people, or events, and did not include 
positive representations of LGBTQ+ topics in 
sex education. Furthermore, regarding curricular 
resources, most students did not have access 
to LGBTQ+-inclusive materials and resources, 
including LGBTQ+-related textbooks or other 
assigned readings, LGBTQ+-inclusive content 
in the curriculum, and LGBTQ+-related library 
resources. 

could only identify five or fewer supportive staff. 
Furthermore, less than half of LGBTQ+ students 
reported that their school administration was 
somewhat or very supportive, and over a third of 
the students reported that their administration 
was neutral in terms of supportiveness. In order to 
create an inclusive school environment for LGBTQ+ 
students, it is important for students to have a 
wide network of staff at school that they can turn 
to, and administrators that are proactive in their 
support for LGBTQ+ students.

Finally, few LGBTQ+ students reported having 
comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment policies 
or supportive transgender and nonbinary student 
policies in their school or district. These findings 
indicate that more efforts are needed to provide 
positive supports in schools in order to create 
safer and more affirming school environments for 
LGBTQ+ students.

Regarding supportive school personnel, although 
the vast majority of students could identify at least 
one supportive school staff member, many students 

The 2020–2021 school year was unique in that 
the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions to 

57

schools across the country, which in turn impacted 
LGBTQ+ students’ access to and knowledge 
of supportive resources. Overall, students who 
attended school in person for the entire year had 
access to fewer supportive school resources than 
did student who attended schools that transitioned 
to full or partial online instruction. LGBTQ+ 
students who attended school only in-person 
reported less access to inclusive curriculum, 
supportive educators, and comprehensive policies. 
It is possible that online instruction provided 
opportunities for LGBTQ+ inclusion and support 
in instruction that did not exist in in-person 
classrooms. For example, teaching classes from 
their own homes away from the actual or perceived 
surveillance of administration may have provided 

educators more freedom to be supportive and 
inclusive of LGBTQ+ students and topics. The 
exception to this pattern regarding LGBTQ+ 
supports was that in-person only instruction 
provided less access to GSAs. Although there were 
no differences in whether schools had a GSA or 
not, students who attended school only in-person 
participated in their school’s GSA at a higher rate 
than did students who attended school online for 
the whole year or for part of the year. It is possible 
that GSAs met less frequently in virtual spaces. 
However, it may also be that students may prefer 
meeting with peers in real life as opposed to in a 
virtual setting or that students were less comfortable 
attending the GSA online while at home.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYUTILITY OF SCHOOL-BASED RESOURCES AND SUPPORTS

School-based resources, such as supportive student 
clubs, LGBTQ+-inclusive curricula, supportive 
school personnel, and inclusive, supportive 
policies, may contribute directly to a more positive 
school environment for LGBTQ+ students.157 These 
institutional supports may also indirectly foster 
better school outcomes and well-being for students 
by decreasing the incidence of negative school 
climate factors, such as anti-LGBTQ+ remarks and 
victimization.158 In this section, we examine the 
relationship between school-based institutional 
supports and school climate, as well as educational 
indicators (specifically, absenteeism, academic 
achievement, educational aspirations, and school 
belonging), and indicators of student well-
being (specifically, self-esteem, depression, and 
suicidality).

Supportive Student Clubs

Previous research has shown that student clubs 
that address issues of sexual orientation and 
gender identity/expression (such as Gay-Straight 
Alliances or Gender and Sexuality Alliances, 
often known as GSAs) can provide a safe space 
for LGBTQ+ students.159 The presence of a GSA 
may also contribute to a more respectful student 
body by raising awareness of LGBTQ+ issues, as 
well as demonstrate to LGBTQ+ students that 
they have allies in their schools.160 As such, GSAs 
can contribute to safer and more inclusive school 
climates for LGBTQ+ students.161

Biased Language, School Safety, and Absenteeism. 
We found that LGBTQ+ students who had an active 
GSA in their school:

• heard anti-LGBTQ+ remarks less frequently 
than LGBTQ+ students in schools without a 
GSA (see Figure 2.11).162 For instance, 56.6% 
of students in schools with a GSA at school 
heard “gay” used in a negative way, compared 
to 74.3% of students in schools without a GSA 
at school;

• were less likely to feel unsafe than LGBTQ+ 

students in schools without a GSA because of 
their sexual orientation, gender expression, or 
gender (see Figure 2.12);163 

• experienced less severe in-person victimization 
than LGBTQ+ students in schools without a 
GSA related to their sexual orientation, gender 
expression, or gender (see Figure 2.13);164 

• experienced less frequent online victimization 
than LGBTQ+ students in schools without a 
GSA related to their sexual orientation, gender 
expression, or gender (see Figure 2.14);165 and

• were less likely to have missed school in 

the past month because of feeling unsafe or 
uncomfortable (24.4% vs. 36.3% without an 
active GSA).166

Students’ Connections to School Staff. Given that 
GSAs typically include at least one faculty advisor, 
the presence of a GSA may make it easier for 
LGBTQ+ students to identify a supportive school 
staff person. Indeed, students in schools with an 
active GSA available could identify more supportive 
staff members than students in schools without an 
active GSA available.167 For example, as shown in 
Figure 2.15, most LGBTQ+ students (67.9%) with 
an active GSA reported having many supportive 
staff, compared to 46.6% of those without an active 
GSA in their school. Additionally, LGBTQ+ students 
in schools with an active available GSA were more 
likely to say that they felt comfortable discussing 
LGBTQ+ issues with their teachers than students 
in schools without an active GSA — half of students 
(52.0%) with a GSA indicated that they felt 
“somewhat” or “very” comfortable talking with their 
teachers about LGBTQ+ issues, compared to just 
over a third of students (36.7%) without a GSA.168  

By increasing awareness of anti-LGBTQ+ bias 
in the school environment or promoting training 
for educators on LGBTQ+ issues, GSAs may help 
increase rates of staff intervention in anti-LGBTQ+ 
biased remarks. We found that staff in schools with 
active GSAs available intervened in homophobic 
remarks and negative remarks about gender 
expression more frequently than educators in 
schools without an active GSA available (see Figure 
2.16).169 For example, 16.0% of staff in schools 
with GSAs available intervened in homophobic 
remarks most of the time or always, compared to 
10.2% of staff in schools without GSAs available. 

Achievement and Aspirations. In general, 
participation in extracurricular clubs and activities 
has been found to be related to improved 
academic performance.170 In addition to this 
positive impact, GSAs may specifically help to 
create a more positive school climate for LGBTQ+

engagement and educational outcomes. We found, 
in fact, that LGBTQ+ students in schools with a 
GSA reported higher grade point averages (GPAs) 
than those in schools without a GSA (see Figure 
2.17).171 We also found that LGBTQ+ students who 
had a GSA available at their school were somewhat 
more likely to say that they planned to pursue some 
type of education beyond high school than those 
who did not have a GSA available at their school 
(see also Figure 2.16).172 

Peer Acceptance and Intervention. GSAs provide 
an opportunity for LGBTQ+ students and their 
allies to meet together in the school environment, 
and they may also provide an opportunity for 
LGBTQ+ students and issues to be visible to other 
students in school. In addition, GSAs may engage 

in activities designed to combat anti-LGBTQ+ 
prejudice and raise awareness about LGBTQ+ 
issues in school. In fact, LGBTQ+ students in our 
survey with an active GSA in their school were 
much more likely than students without a GSA to 
participate in a GLSEN Day of Action,173 such as 
the Day of Silence (20.4% of those with an active 
GSA vs. 9.4% of those without).174 As such, GSAs 
may foster greater acceptance of LGBTQ+ people 
among the student body, which then may result 
in a more positive school climate for LGBTQ+ 
students.

Among all students in our survey, 40.5% reported 
that their peers were somewhat or very accepting of 
LGBTQ+ people.175 Students who attended schools 
with a GSA were much more likely than those 
without a GSA to report that their classmates were

accepting of LGBTQ+ people. LGBTQ+ students 
in schools with GSAs available were more likely 
to describe their peers as accepting compared 
to students in schools without a GSA available 
(55.4% vs. 32.4%).176 Additionally, GSAs were 
related to increased student intervention in biased 
remarks; students in schools with GSAs reported 
that other students intervened more often when 
hearing homophobic remarks and negative remarks 
about gender expression than those in schools 
without GSAs (see also Figure 2.15).177

School Belonging. In that the availability of GSAs 
is related to more supportive educators and more 
accepting peers, LGBTQ+ students who have a 
GSA may then feel a greater part of the school 
community. We found, in fact, that LGBTQ+ 
students with a GSA reported higher levels of 
school belonging than those without a GSA.178 

Well-Being. By virtue of the relationship of GSAs 
to increased feelings of belonging and a greater 
sense of safety at school, they may then also have 
a positive effect on LGBTQ+ student well-being. In 
fact, we found that LGBTQ+ students in schools 
with GSAs reported lower levels of depression 
and higher levels of self-esteem than students in 
schools without GSAs.179 Additionally, we found that 
LGBTQ+ students in schools with GSAs were less 
likely to have seriously considered suicide in the 
past year than LGBTQ+ students without a GSA.180 

Overall, we found that the presence of an active 
GSA is related to a more positive school climate. 
LGBTQ+ students who had a GSA in their 
school reported less anti-LGBTQ+ remarks and 
victimization, were less likely to report that they 

feel unsafe, and were less likely to miss school 
because they feel unsafe. Additionally, LGBTQ+ 
students with a GSA in their school could identify 
more supportive school staff, reported that they 
felt more comfortable talking to their teachers 
about LGBTQ+ issues, and were more likely to have 
staff intervene when anti-LGBTQ+ remarks were 
made. LGBTQ+ students with GSAs also reported 
higher GPAs and higher educational aspirations. 
Regarding their peers, LGBTQ+ students with a 
GSA available reported more accepting peers, as 
well as a higher likelihood of peers intervening 
when hearing anti-LGBTQ+ remarks. Finally, 
LGBTQ+ students at schools with a GSA reported 
higher levels of school belonging, lower levels of 
depression, higher levels of self-esteem, and a lower 
likelihood of seriously considering suicide, when 
compared to their LGBTQ+ peers without a GSA. 

Inclusive Curricular Resources

Many experts in multicultural education believe 
that a curriculum that is inclusive of diverse 
groups — including diverse cultures, races, 
ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations —  
instills a belief in the intrinsic worth of all 
individuals and in the value of a diverse society.181 
Including LGBTQ+-related issues in the curriculum 
in a positive manner may make LGBTQ+ students 
feel like more valued members of the school 
community, and it may also promote more positive 
feelings about LGBTQ+ issues and persons 
among their peers, thereby resulting in a more 
positive school climate.182 Thus, we examined the 
relationship between access to positive LGBTQ+ 
curricular resources and various indicators of 
school climate and well-being.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYBiased Language. Among the LGBTQ+ students in 
our survey, attending a school that included positive 
representations of LGBTQ+ topics in the curriculum 
was related to less frequent use of anti-LGBTQ+ 
language.183 Specifically, LGBTQ+ students in 
schools with LGBTQ+ inclusion in the curriculum:

• heard homophobic remarks less frequently (see 
Figure 2.18) than students in schools without 
an inclusive curriculum;

• heard negative remarks about gender 

expression less frequently than students in 
schools without an inclusive curriculum (see 
also Figure 2.18); and

• heard negative remarks about transgender 

people less frequently than students in schools 
without an inclusive curriculum (see also 
Figure 2.18).

Victimization and School Safety. Attending a school 
with positive LGBTQ+ inclusion in the curriculum 

was also related to greater school safety and  
fewer absences related to feeling unsafe at  
school. Specifically, LGBTQ+ students in schools 
with LGBTQ+ curricular inclusion, compared to 
those without:

• were less likely to feel unsafe at school 

regarding their sexual orientation, gender 
expression, and gender (see Figure 2.19);184

• were less likely to report having missed at least 

one day of school due to feeling unsafe or 
uncomfortable (54.7% vs. 67.1%).185

• reported less severe in-person victimization 

based on sexual orientation, gender expression, 
and gender (see Figure 2.20);186 and

• reported less severe online victimization based 
on sexual orientation, gender expression, and 
gender (see Figure 2.21).187

Students’ Connections to School Staff. When 
educators include LGBTQ+ content in their 
curriculum, they may also be sending a message 
that they are open to discussing LGBTQ+ issues 
with their students. LGBTQ+ students in schools 
with an inclusive curriculum were more likely to 
say they felt comfortable discussing these issues 
with their teachers than students in schools 
without an inclusive curriculum — almost two-thirds 
of students (63.2%) with an inclusive curriculum 
indicated they felt “somewhat” or “very” 
comfortable talking with their teachers about these 

issues, compared to just over one-third of students 
(37.9%) without an inclusive curriculum.188

Achievement and Aspirations. Inclusive curricula 
can serve a vital role in creating an affirming 
learning environment where LGBTQ+ students see 
themselves reflected in their classroom. This may 
result in increased student engagement and may 
encourage students to strive academically which, 
in turn, may yield better educational outcomes. 
Indeed, we found that LGBTQ+ students in schools 
with an inclusive curriculum reported higher grade

an inclusive curriculum (see Figure 2.22).189 We 
also found that students with an LGBTQ+-inclusive 
curriculum evidenced somewhat higher academic 
aspirations — LGBTQ+ students in schools with an 
inclusive curriculum were more likely to say that 
they planned to pursue some type of education 
beyond high school compared to LGBTQ+ students 
in schools without an inclusive curriculum (see 
also Figure 2.22).190

Peer Acceptance and Peer Intervention. The 
inclusion of positive portrayals of LGBTQ+ topics in 
the classroom may not only have a direct effect on 
LGBTQ+ students’ experiences, but may also help 
educate the general student body about LGBTQ+ 
issues and promote respect and understanding 
of LGBTQ+ people in general. LGBTQ+ students 
who attended schools with an LGBTQ+-inclusive 
curriculum were much more likely to report that 
their classmates were somewhat or very accepting 
of LGBTQ+ people (66.9% vs. 35.3%).191 

Increased understanding and respect may lead 
students in general to speak up when they witness 
anti-LGBTQ+ behaviors. Although overall rates 
of students’ intervention regarding these types of 
remarks were low, we found that LGBTQ+ students 
in schools with an inclusive curriculum reported 
that other students were more than twice as likely 
to intervene most or all of the time when hearing 
homophobic remarks and negative remarks about 
gender expression, compared to students in schools 
without an inclusive curriculum (see Figure 2.23).192

School Belonging. Given that having positive 
curricular inclusion was related to a greater number 
of supportive educators and more accepting peers, 
it is likely that being taught a curriculum that 

is inclusive of LGBTQ+ people and topics would 
also be related to LGBTQ+ students feeling more 
connected to their school community. Indeed, we 
found that access to an inclusive curriculum was 
related to more school belonging.193

Well-Being. Being taught positive content about 
LGBTQ+ people, history, and events may also 
result in LGBTQ+ students feeling more positively 
about themselves and their LGBTQ+ identity. We 
found that LGBTQ+ students who had been taught 
positive LGBTQ+ content in school:

• had higher levels of self-esteem than those did 
not report positive LGBTQ+ inclusion in the 
curriculum;194

• had lower levels of depression than those did 
not report positive LGBTQ+ inclusion in the 
curriculum;195  and

• were less likely to have seriously considered 

suicide in the past year.196

Overall, we found that access to inclusive 
curriculum is related to a more positive school 
climate. Students who are taught an LGBTQ+-
inclusive curriculum report less anti-LGBTQ+ 
biased language and victimization, and are less 
likely to feel unsafe and miss school because 
of their LGBTQ+ identity than those who do not 
have access to LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum. 
LGBTQ+ students with an inclusive curriculum 
are more comfortable talking to school staff about 
LGBTQ+ topics and report that their peers are more 
accepting. Finally, students at schools with an 
inclusive curriculum report higher levels of school 
belonging and self-esteem and lower levels of 
depression. However, as we saw in the Availability

of School-Based Resources and Supports section, 
most LGBTQ+ students are not taught positive 
LGBTQ+-related information and many lack access 
to other LGBTQ+-inclusive curricular resources at 
school. It is important for educators to implement 
LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum in their classes, as 
increased access to LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum 
and curricular resources can lead to more positive 
school experiences for LGBTQ+ students.

Supportive School Personnel

Having supportive teachers and school staff 
can have a positive effect on the educational 
experiences of any student, and has been shown  
to increase student motivation to learn and  
positive engagement in school.197 Given that 
LGBTQ+ students often feel unsafe and  
unwelcome in school, having access to school 
personnel who provide support may be particularly 
critical for these students.198 Therefore, we 
examined the relationships between the presence 
of supportive staff and several indicators of school 
climate.

School Safety and Absenteeism. Having staff 
supportive of LGBTQ+ students was related to 
feeling safer in school and missing fewer days of 
school. As shown in Figure 2.24, students with 
more supportive staff at their schools were less likely 
to feel unsafe regarding their sexual orientation, 
gender expression, or gender, as well as less 
likely to miss school because of feeling unsafe or 
uncomfortable.199 For example, 34.7% of students 
with a high number (11 or more) of supportive 
staff reported feeling unsafe regarding their sexual 
orientation, compared to 64.2% of students with a 
low number (0 to 5) of supportive staff.

Achievement and Aspirations. Supportive staff 
members serve a vital role in creating an affirming 
learning environment that engages students 
and encourages them to strive academically. 
Therefore, it stands to reason that supportive 
staff would be related to LGBTQ+ students’ 
educational outcomes. We found that students 
with more supportive staff had greater educational 
aspirations.200 For example, as seen in Figure 
2.24, whereas most of the LGBTQ+ students in

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYthe survey planned on pursuing education beyond 
high school, the percent increased as the number 
of supportive educators increased — from 85.4% 
among those with few supportive educators 
to 91.7% for those with a greater number of 
supportive educators. Similarly, we also found that 
students with more supportive staff reported higher 
GPAs — 55.7% with a low number of supportive 
staff reported having above average GPAs versus 
65.6% of students with a high number of 
supportive staff (see also Figure 2.25).201

School Belonging. Having supportive school 
personnel may also enhance a student’s connection 
to school. LGBTQ+ students in schools with 
more supportive staff had higher levels of school 
belonging than those who reported fewer supportive 
educators. Three-quarters (76.0%) of LGBTQ+ 
students with a higher number of supportive 
educators at school (11 or more) reported higher 
levels of school belonging, compared to half 
(51.7%) of students with a moderate number of 
supportive educators (6 to 10) and less than a 
third (31.0%) with few supportive educators (5  
or fewer).202

Psychological Well-Being. Having supportive school 
personnel may also enhance LGBTQ+ students’ 
feelings about themselves and their mental health. 
Students with more supportive school personnel:

• had higher levels of self-esteem than those 

who reported fewer supportive educators (see 
Figure 2.26); 203

• were less likely to have seriously considered 

suicide in the past year than those who 
reported fewer supportive educators (see also 
Figure 2.26).205

Staff Responses to Anti-LGBTQ+ Remarks and 
Victimization. School staff members serve a vital 
role in ensuring a safe learning environment for all 
students, and, as such, should respond to biased 
language and all types of victimization. We found 
that when staff intervened more often when anti-
LGBTQ+ remarks were made, LGBTQ+ students:

• felt less unsafe at school regarding their sexual 
orientation, gender expression, or gender (see 
Figure 2.27);206 and 

• were less likely to miss school due to feeling 

unsafe or uncomfortable — 35.8% of students 
whose school staff intervened less often (never 
or only some of the time) when anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks were made missed at least one day of 
school in the past year compared to 26.4% of 
those whose staff intervened more frequently 
(most of the time or always).207 

Efficacy of Staff Responses to Anti-LGBTQ+ 
Victimization. Clear and appropriate actions on 
the part of school staff regarding harassment and 
assault can improve the school environment for 
LGBTQ+ youth and may also serve to deter future 
acts of victimization.208 When students believed 
that staff effectively addressed harassment and 
assault, they:

• had lower levels of depression than those who 

reported fewer supportive educators (see Figure 
2.26);204 and

• felt less unsafe at school regarding their sexual 
orientation, gender expression, or gender (see 
Figure 2.28);209

victimization at school based on their sexual

among those LGBTQ+ students who had been 
in school in-person at some point during the 
academic year (see Figure 2.29);211 and

online at some point during the academic year 
(see Figure 2.30).212

Visible Displays of Support. One of the many ways 
that educators can demonstrate to LGBTQ+ students 
that they are supportive allies is through visible 
displays of support, such as GLSEN’s Safe Space 
stickers and posters. LGBTQ+ students who reported 
seeing Safe Space stickers and posters were more 
likely to report having supportive teachers and other 
staff at their schools.213 For instance, as shown in 
Figure 2.31, half of students (50.1%) who had seen 
a Safe Space sticker or poster were able to identify a 
high number of supportive staff (11 or more) in their 
schools, compared to less than a fifth of students 
(17.8%) who had not seen a Safe Space sticker or 
poster at school.

at school based on their sexual orientation,

LGBTQ+-supportive school staff play a critical 
role in creating a more positive school climate 
for LGBTQ+ students. When LGBTQ+ students

they can turn, they feel safer and more connected 
to the school community, and are more likely to 
plan on graduating and going on to post-secondary 
education. Further, when school staff demonstrate 
their support for LGBTQ+ students by intervening 
on anti-LGBTQ+ language or effectively responding 
to harassment, they help to reduce hostile school 
experiences for LGBTQ+ youth, thereby improving 
the learning environment for LGBTQ+ students. 
Our findings also highlight the importance of 

having several LGBTQ+-supportive staff at school, 
rather than only a few. Having a large network of 
supportive staff may create more spaces throughout 
the school where LGBTQ+ students can feel at 
ease about their identities, and where anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks and harassment are interrupted. Thus, 
schools must invest in professional development 
for all staff on recognizing and responding to 
the needs of LGBTQ+ students, and effectively 
intervening in bias-based harassment.

Inclusive and Supportive School Policies

Inclusive and supportive school policies can help 
to ensure that students are safe, respected, and 
feel valued in their school. Not only do policies 
specify prohibited and allowable behaviors, but 
they also serve to set a tone for the entire school 
community. When these policies are supportive 
of LGBTQ+ students, they can contribute to more 
positive school climate for these students.

Policies for Addressing Bullying and Harassment. 
Comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment policies 
can help ensure schools are safe for LGBTQ+ 
students in that they explicitly state protections 
from victimization based on sexual orientation 
and gender identity/expression. Furthermore, 
comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment policies 
may also provide school staff with the guidance 
needed to appropriately intervene when students 
use anti-LGBTQ+ language and when LGBTQ+ 
students report incidents of harassment and 
assault.

Anti-LGBTQ+ language. Overall, LGBTQ+ students 
in schools with comprehensive policies were the 
least likely to hear anti-LGBTQ+ language and 
those with no anti-bullying/harassment policy 
were most likely to hear such language (see Figure 
2.32).214 For example, 30.6% of students in

schools with a comprehensive policy commonly 
heard negative remarks about transgender people, 
compared to 38.6% of students in schools with 
partially enumerated policies, 39.9% in schools 
with generic policies, and 43.4% in schools with 
no policy. With the exception of using “gay” in a 
negative way, there were no differences between 
having a generic policy and a partially enumerated 
policy.

Responses to anti-LGBTQ+ remarks. School 
anti-bullying/harassment policies often provide 
guidance to educators in addressing incidents 
of harassment and biased remarks. Even 
though students reported, in general, that staff 
intervention was a rare occurrence, it was more 
common in schools with anti-bullying policies. 
Students in schools with comprehensive policies 
reported the highest frequencies of staff 
intervention when anti-LGBTQ+ remarks occurred, 
followed by partially enumerated policies, 
and generic policies (see Figure 2.33).215 For 
example, a quarter of LGBTQ+ students (24.5%) 
in schools with comprehensive polices said 
teachers intervened most of the time or always 
when homophobic remarks were made, compared 
to under a fifth of those (16.4%) in schools with 
partially enumerated policies, 11.6% in schools 
with a generic policy, and 7.2% of schools with  
no policy.

Experiences of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization. Among 
LGBTQ+ students who attended school in person at 
some point in the academic year, those who were 
in schools with no anti-bullying and harassment 
policy reported the highest levels of experiences 
with in-person anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and 
those in schools with comprehensive policies 
experienced the lowest levels (see Figure 2.34).216 
There were no differences, however, in the three 
types of in-person victimization between students 
in schools with a generic policy (i.e., those that 
have no enumeration) and those in schools with 
only partially enumerated policies. For example, 
as shown in Figure 2.34, 20.2% of students in 
schools with a comprehensive policy reported 
higher levels of in-person victimization based 
on gender expression, compared to 26.8% in 
schools with a partially enumerated policy, 26.2% 
in schools with a generic policy, and 31.9% in 
schools with no policy. Among LGBTQ+ students 
who attended school online at some point in the 
academic year, those who were in schools with 
no anti-bullying and harassment policy reported 

70

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYthe highest levels of all three types of online 
victimization (see Figure 2.35), and those who 
were in schools with a generic policy reported 
greater online victimization than those with a 
comprehensive policy.217 However, those who had 
a partially enumerated policy did not differ in the 
severity of victimization from those with a generic 
policy and those who had a comprehensive policy.

2.36, students in schools with a comprehensive 
school policy were most likely to report 
victimization to school staff compared to all other 
students in the survey, students in schools with 
a partially enumerated policy were more likely to 
report than those in schools with generic policies, 
and students in schools without a policy were least 
likely to report harassment or assault.218 

Students’ reporting of victimization to school staff 
and effectiveness of staff response. Policies may 
provide guidance to students on reporting bullying 
and harassment, but perhaps more importantly, 
policies may also signal that students’ experiences 
of victimization will be addressed by school 
officials. We found that the levels of specific 
protections for sexual orientation and gender 
expression was associated with a greater likelihood 
of LGBTQ+ students reporting harassment or 
assault to school personnel. As shown in Figure 

Anti-bullying and harassment policies that 
include protections based on sexual orientation 
and gender expression may also signal to school 
personnel the importance of addressing anti-
LGBTQ+ victimization in their schools. As also 
shown in Figure 2.36, LGBTQ+ students in 
schools with comprehensive policies reported 
that staff intervention regarding victimization was 
more effective. LGBTQ+ students in schools with 
comprehensive policies and partially enumerated 
policies were more likely to report that staff

those with no policy were least likely to report that 
staff intervention was effective.219 

Collectively, these findings suggest that 
comprehensive policies are more effective than 
other types of policies in promoting a safe school 
environment for LGBTQ+ students. These policies 
may send the message to teachers and other school 
staff that responding to LGBTQ+-based harassment 
is expected and critical. As we saw in our results, 
school personnel intervened more often and more 
effectively when the school was reported to have a 
comprehensive policy. In addition, comprehensive 
policies may be effective in curtailing anti-LGBTQ+ 
language and behaviors among students — students 
in schools with comprehensive policies reported 
the lowest incidence of homophobic remarks, 

negative remarks about gender expression, 
negative remarks about transgender people, 
and reported the lowest levels of anti-LGBTQ+ 
victimization. These policies may also send 
a message to students that LGBTQ+-based 
harassment is not tolerated, and that students 
should take appropriate action when witnessing 
LGBTQ+-based harassment. Thus, comprehensive 
policies may signal to all members of the school 
community that anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and 
biased remarks are not tolerated. It is important to 
note that these results also indicate that having a 
partially enumerated policy, i.e., one that includes 
protections for sexual orientation or gender but 
not both, often did not have any greater effect on 
preventing anti-LGBTQ+ behaviors in schools than 
having a generic policy with no specific LGBTQ+ 
protections and even having no policy at all. These

bullying/harassment policies to be comprehensive 
and specifically enumerate protections based on 
sexual orientation and gender identity and gender 
expression.

Policies and Official Guidelines on Transgender 
and Nonbinary Students. School or district policies 
detailing the rights and protections afforded to 
transgender and nonbinary students help to ensure 
these students have access to an education. These 
policies can also serve to send the message that 
transgender and nonbinary students are a valuable 
and important part of the school community.

Transgender and nonbinary official policies/
guidelines and school engagement. Having policies 
that provide access and support to transgender 
and nonbinary students may help students 
feel comfortable and welcome in their school, 
ultimately resulting in greater school engagement. 
We found transgender and nonbinary students 
in schools who had these policies or guidelines, 
compared to those who did not, were:

• Less likely to miss school because of feeling 
unsafe (30.7% vs. 38.2% missed at least 
one day of school in the past month for safety 
reasons); 220 and

• More likely to feel a part of their school 

community (69.2% vs. 42.0% reported higher 
levels of school belonging).221 

Transgender and nonbinary policies/guidelines 
and students’ experiences of discrimination. We 
examined whether the presence of a policy or 

official guidelines supporting transgender and 
nonbinary students was related to experiences 
of gender-related discrimination at school 
for these students. We found that having a 
supportive transgender and nonbinary policy was 
related to a lower likelihood of gender-related 
discrimination — specifically, being prevented 
from using bathrooms of their gender identity, 
prevented from using locker rooms of their gender 
identity, prevented from wearing clothes deemed 
“inappropriate” based on gender, prevented from 
participating on a school sports team based on 
gender, and being prevented from using their 
chosen name or pronouns.222 For example, as 
shown in Figure 2.36, transgender and nonbinary 
students in schools with a transgender and 
nonbinary student policy were less than half 
as likely as those in schools without a policy to 
experience discrimination related to their name or 
pronouns in school (19.4% vs. 54.2%).

In addition to exploring the overall benefits of 
having a school policy or guidelines for transgender 
and nonbinary students with regard to gender-
related discrimination, we also examined whether 
specific components of these policies or guidelines 
were effective vis-à-vis specific forms of gender-
related discrimination at school. For example,  
we examined: 1) whether protections regarding 
boys/girls bathrooms and gender-neutral bathrooms 
were related to a lower likelihood of discrimination 
in bathroom use; 2) whether protections related 
to locker rooms were related to a lower likelihood 
of locker room discrimination; and 3) whether 
protections regarding name/pronoun use were 
related to a lower likelihood of discrimination 
regarding name or pronoun use. Overall, our

results indicate that specific protections 
were protective toward the related form of 
discrimination. Specifically, transgender and 
nonbinary students had a:

• 70.5% lower likelihood of experiencing 

discrimination regarding name or pronoun 
at school if they had a school policy or 
guideline that covered name or pronoun use, 
and a 41.0% lower likelihood if the policy or 
guideline addressed changing school records 
after a name or gender change;223

• 47.4% lower likelihood of experiencing 

discrimination regarding clothing if the policy 
or guideline addressed following dress codes 
or wearing uniforms matching one’s gender 
identity;224

• 64.7% lower likelihood of experiencing 

discrimination regarding bathroom use if the 
policy or guideline addressed choosing which 
bathroom to use, and a 44.6% lower likelihood 
if the policy or guideline addressed access to 
gender-neutral bathrooms;225

• 64.0% lower likelihood of experiencing 

discrimination regarding locker room use if the 
policy or guideline addressed access to locker 
rooms matching one’s gender identity;226 and

• 74.1% lower likelihood of experiencing 

discrimination regarding participation on 
school sports teams if the policy or guideline 
addressed participation in school sports 
matching one’s gender identity.227

These findings indicate that having specific 
policies or official guidelines that explicitly 
document the rights of transgender and nonbinary 
students can greatly improve the school experience 
for these students. Given transgender and 
nonbinary students are at higher risk of in-school 
victimization, absenteeism, school discipline, and 
ultimately leaving school altogether,228 it is critical 
that schools institute policies to help safeguard 
these students’ rights and ensure they have equal 
access to an education. These findings not only 
highlight the importance of school policies or 

guidelines for transgender and nonbinary students, 
but also highlight the importance of having 
clear specifications to prevent gender-related 
discrimination. For instance, the findings regarding 
locker room and bathroom discrimination indicate 
that allowing students to access gendered facilities 
that correspond to their gender are critical for 
transgender and nonbinary students. Although 
having official protections for transgender and 
nonbinary students and their rights is crucial, the 
power of the policy is in the degree to which it is 
implemented. Professional development is critical 
to ensure that school staff are aware of policy 
mandates including those that protect transgender 
and nonbinary students, and are able to enact 
them. Furthermore, schools and districts should 
develop monitoring and accountability measures 
to ensure that these policies are being effectively 
implemented and that transgender and nonbinary 
students are not being deprived of their rights.

Supportive and inclusive school policies play 
an essential role in creating safe and inclusive 
school communities. However, it is important 
to note that a significant portion of students in 
schools with these policies still faced hostile 
school climates — including victimization and 
discrimination — even when they reported having 
an anti-bullying/harassment policy or a transgender 
and nonbinary student policy. Clearly, it is not 
enough for policies to merely exist in schools, 
but they must also be enforced and effectively 
implemented. For both types of policies, anti-
bullying and harassment policies and transgender 
student policies or guidelines, a substantial portion 
of students indicated that they did not know 
whether their school had such policies (see Table 
2.3 and Figure 2.10 in “Availability of School-
Based Resources and Supports” section). If a 
student is not aware of their school’s policies, then 
they would not be aware of the valuable rights and 
protections these policies provide. Therefore, it is 
critical not only that schools enact these policies 
but also that all members of the school community 
are made aware of the policies and what they 
include. Furthermore, policies are vitally important, 
yet are only one of the key elements necessary to 
ensure safe and welcoming schools for LGBTQ+ 
students.

Conclusions

Our findings indicate that LGBTQ+ supports and 
resources play an important role in making schools 
safer and more affirming for LGBTQ+ students. 
Students in schools that had a GSA and students 
in schools that had LGBTQ+ inclusive curriculum 
(taught positive representations of LGBTQ+ 
people, history, and events) reported less anti-
LGBTQ+ biased language and less anti-LGBTQ+ 
victimization, were less likely to feel unsafe and 
to miss school for safety reasons. They were more 
comfortable talking to school staff about LGBTQ+ 
topics, reported more accepting peers, had higher 
GPAs and educational aspirations, reported 
a greater sense of belonging to their school 
community and increased psychological well-being. 
Further, students at schools with a GSA reported a 
higher number of supportive educators, and more 
frequent intervention on homophobic language by 
both staff and other students. Our findings also 
showed that students with more supportive school 
staff were less likely to feel unsafe and to miss 
school for safety reasons, had higher GPAs, higher 
educational aspirations, and reported a greater 
sense of belonging to their school community and 
increased psychological well-being. 

Students in schools with comprehensive anti-
bullying/harassment policies that included 
protections for both sexual orientation and 
gender identity/expression reported less anti-
LGBTQ+ biased language and less anti-LGBTQ+ 

victimization. Students with comprehensive 
policies also reported greater frequency of school 
staff intervention regarding anti-LGBTQ+ biased 
remarks, were more likely to report incidents of 
harassment and assault to school personnel, and 
more likely to rate school staff’s response to such 
incidents as effective. Furthermore, having a policy 
that enumerated either sexual orientation or gender 
expression but not both was often no more effective 
than a policy with no enumeration or no policy at 
all. Among transgender and nonbinary students, 
those in schools with supportive transgender and 
nonbinary official policies or guidelines reported 
less gender-related discrimination, were less likely 
to miss school because of feeling unsafe, and 
felt a greater sense of connection to their school 
community.

Unfortunately, as discussed previously in the 
Availability of School-Based Resources and 
Supports section, many LGBTQ+ students do 
not have access to these supports and resources 
at their schools. These findings indicate the 
importance of advocating for the inclusion of these 
resources in schools to ensure positive learning 
environments for LGBTQ+ students in all schools. 
In addition, in the aforementioned section, we 
found that LGBTQ+ students in in-person learning 
environments during the 2020–2021 school year 
were often less likely to have than those in online 
only learning or hybrid environments, and as such, 
schools may need to compensate for this difference 
as they return to their regular in-person learning.

PART THREE: 
SCHOOL CLIMATE 
BY DEMOGRAPHIC 
AND SCHOOL 
CHARACTERISTICS

SCHOOL CLIMATE AND SEXUAL ORIENTATION

An important element of adolescent development 
is identity formation, in which youth explore and 
come to define their personal identity, both as an 
individual and as a member of different social 
groups.229 Youth in our survey were navigating the 
development of multiple identities, including their 
sexual orientation identity. As it is a developmental 
process, age plays a role in identity formation. 
Older youth, who have had more time to explore 
and develop their identity, may be more secure 
and confident about their lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
pansexual, queer, or asexual identity, which could 
contribute to different school experiences than 
younger youth. In fact, we found that age was 
related to sexual orientation identity. For example, 
questioning students were younger than students of 
all other sexual orientations.230

One of the last steps of sexual orientation identity 
formation is coming out publicly about one’s 
lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, queer or asexual 
identity.231 Students who have reached this stage 
of identity development may be more confident 
in their identity, but also may be more targeted 
for victimization and discrimination. Indeed, 
previous research has shown that being out about 
one’s LGBTQ+ identity at school relates to greater 
peer victimization.232 In our survey, students who 
identified as queer or as gay or lesbian were, in 
general, more out to both peers and school staff 
than students of other sexual orientations (see 
Figure 3.1).233   

LGBTQ+ students in our sample were not only 
navigating their sexual orientation identity; many 
were also developing their non-cisgender gender 

identities. It is important to reiterate that sexual 
orientation identity and gender identity are not 
wholly independent among LGBTQ+ youth with 
regard to peer victimization and issues related 
to school climate, and prior research has shown 
that transgender and nonbinary students are more 
likely to have negative school experiences than 
cisgender students.234 In our survey, pansexual, 
queer, and asexual students were less likely to be 
cisgender — they were more likely to identify as 
transgender, genderqueer, nonbinary, or another 
non-cisgender identity than were gay and lesbian, 
bisexual, and questioning students.235 A majority of 
pansexual (72.0%), queer (71.6%), and  asexual 
(67.9%) students did not identity as cisgender. 
Among questioning students, 50.5% identified as 
something other than cisgender. Alternatively, gay 
and lesbian and bisexual students were more likely 
to identify as cisgender than were pansexual and 
questioning students236, and 43.7% of gay and 
lesbian students and 42.4% of bisexual students 
identified as such. 

We examined differences in school climate 
and students’ school experiences across 
sexual orientation groups — gay and lesbian 
students, bisexual students, pansexual 
students, queer students, asexual students, and 
students questioning their sexual orientation 
(“questioning”).237 Because of the differences in 
age, outness to peers and adults in school, and 
gender identity discussed above, and the fact that 
they contribute to students’ school experiences, in 
the following analyses we controlled for all these 
characteristics.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYFeelings of Safety at School

Feelings of safety at school differed significantly 
by sexual orientation.238 Gay and lesbian students 
were the most likely to feel unsafe due to their 
sexual orientation and asexual students were 
the least likely, with the exception that asexual 
students were not different from questioning 
students (see Figure 3.2). Queer and pansexual 
students were more likely than many of their peers 
to feel unsafe due to both their gender expression 
and gender, when compared to students of other 
orientations (see also Figure 3.2). 

Victimization

LGBTQ+ students’ experiences of in-school 
victimization differed based on their sexual 
orientation (see Figure 3.3 and 3.4):239

• The majority experienced in-person harassment 
or assault based on sexual orientation across 
most sexual orientation groups, among those 
who were in school in-person at some point 
in the academic year, except for asexual and 
questioning students (see Figure 3.3). The 

highest levels were among pansexual and gay 
and lesbian students (69.0% and 65.4%, 
respectively). 

• The majority of students in all sexual 

orientation groups experienced in-person 
harassment or assault based on gender 
expression in the past year, and pansexual 
students reported the highest levels of this 
victimization compared to all other groups (see 
also Figure 3.3). 

• The majority of students in all sexual 

orientation groups experienced in-person 
victimization based on gender in the past  
year, with the exception of gay and lesbian 
students (see also Figure 3.3). Again, 
pansexual students reported the highest  
levels of this form of victimization compared  
to all other groups.

• Regarding sexual harassment, we found  

that pansexual students reported a higher 
incidence and asexual students reported a 
lower incidence than most other students  
(see Figure 3.4).240

• Gay and lesbian and pansexual students had 
the highest levels of online harassment based 
on sexual orientation across most sexual 
orientation groups, among those who were in 
online learning environments at some point in 
the academic year. 

• Pansexual students had the highest levels of 

online harassment based on gender expression 
across most sexual orientation groups, among 
those who were in online learning environments 
at some point in the academic year. 

• Pansexual students also had the highest levels 
of online harassment based on gender across 
most sexual orientation groups, among those 
who were in online learning environments at 
some point in the academic year.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYDiscriminatory Policies and Practices

Experiences of anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination through 
school policies and practices also varied based on 
students’ sexual orientation.242 Pansexual students 
were more likely to report experiencing some form 
of discrimination at school than all other students 
(see Figure 3.6). For example, over two-thirds 
of pansexual students (68.4%) experienced 
discriminatory policies and practices, compared 

to approximately half of bisexual and questioning 
students (54.8% and 55.0%, respectively).

Discipline

A growing field of research on school discipline 
has suggested that LGBTQ+ students may be at a 
higher risk of experiencing school discipline than 
their non-LGBTQ+ peers,243 but most of these 
studies have not examined sexual orientation

differences within the LGBTQ+ population, 
perhaps because of small sample sizes of LGBTQ+ 
students. Thus, we examined differences in having 
experienced any form of school discipline. As 
shown in Figure 3.7, pansexual students reported 
higher rates of discipline than gay and lesbian, 
queer and asexual students, and bisexual students 
reported more discipline than asexual students.244 

Educational Attachment and Aspirations

Experiencing victimization, discrimination, and 
disproportionate rates of discipline all serve to 
make schools less safe and welcoming for students, 
which could influence students’ desire to attend 
school. Given the earlier finding that pansexual 
students experienced higher rates of victimization, 

it is not surprising that pansexual students were 
more likely than gay and lesbian, bisexual, and 
queer students to report having missed school 
because they felt unsafe (see Figure 3.8).245 For 
example, 39.9% of pansexual students reported 
missing school in the past month due to safety 
concerns, compared to slightly less than a third 
of gay and lesbian (30.7%), bisexual (29.8%), 
and asexual (28.0%) students. With regard to 
educational aspirations, pansexual students were 
less likely to plan on pursuing post-secondary 
education than queer or bisexual students 
(see Figure 3.9).246 With regard to educational 
attachment, pansexual students reported lower 
rates of school belonging than many of their peers 
of other sexual orientations (see also Figure 3.9).

Conclusions

Overall, our results indicate that pansexual 
students reported the most negative school 
experiences in comparison to students of 
other sexual orientations. Pansexual students 
experienced higher levels of sexual harassment, 
victimization based on sexual orientation, 
victimization based on gender identity, and 
victimization based on gender than students of 
many other sexual orientations. Pansexual students 
also experienced more discriminatory policies 
and practices. Additionally, pansexual students 
missed more school due to feeling unsafe, changed 
schools more often, and had lower educational 
aspirations than LGBTQ+ peers of many other 
sexual orientations.

Further research is clearly warranted to understand 
why pansexual students appear to face more hostile 
school climates than other students. This research 
should examine factors related to a student’s 
decision to adopt particular sexual identity labels 
(i.e., why a student who is attracted to people of 
multiple genders may identify as pansexual as 
opposed to queer or bisexual) to better understand 
these different sexual orientation groups. 

These findings reveal a complex picture regarding 
differences among LGBTQ+ students by sexual 
orientation. Asexual students, for example, were 

similar to students of other sexual orientations 
on most of the school climate indicators, except 
for that they reported a lower incidence of sexual 
harassment that most, and experienced less 
victimization based on sexual orientation than 
gay or lesbian and pansexual students. Bisexual 
students experienced less victimization based on 
sexual orientation than gay and lesbian students, 
but more sexual harassment than their gay and 
lesbian peers. However, bisexual youth did not 
differ from gay and lesbian students with regard 
to victimization based on gender, discrimination, 
discipline, and missing school due to safety 
concerns. Yet research on adolescent health 
outcomes has demonstrated that bisexual youth 
are typically at higher risk than both heterosexual 
and lesbian/gay peers on suicidality, substance 
abuse, and intimate partner violence.247 However, 
most of the aforementioned research combines 
sexual orientations that are attracted to more than 
one gender, such as bisexual, pansexual, and 
queer, and does not allow a distinction for the 
differences among these identities. The findings of 
such previous research may actually be reflecting 
the negative experiences of pansexual youth, 
and not necessarily the experiences of youth who 
identify specifically as bisexual and not pansexual. 
More research is needed to better understand 
the complex role sexual identity plays in the 
experiences of adolescents’ lives both in and out  
of school.

SCHOOL CLIMATE AND GENDER

We also examined potential differences in LGBTQ+ 
students’ experiences of safety, victimization, and 
discrimination by gender identity.248 Furthermore, 
we examined school engagement, specifically 
absenteeism for safety reasons, feelings of school 
belonging, changing schools for safety reasons, 
and dropping out. Given the growing attention to 
inequities in administration of school discipline 
and some previous research indicating that 
transgender and nonbinary students are more likely 
to face disciplinary consequences at school,249 we 
also examined gender differences in rates of school 
discipline.

We examine specifically the differences between 
and among cisgender, transgender, nonbinary, and 
questioning students. 

• Cisgender students are those who identify as 

male or female, and whose gender aligns with 
their sex assigned at birth.

• Transgender and nonbinary students are those 
whose gender does not align with their sex 
assigned at birth. Transgender students in our 
sample fell into four different categories: 1) 
transgender boys, i.e., those who identified as 
transgender and male, 2) transgender girls, 
i.e., those who identified as transgender and 
female, 3) transgender nonbinary students, 
i.e., those who identified as transgender 
and nonbinary in some way (i.e., nonbinary, 
genderqueer, agender), and 4) transgender 
only, i.e., those who identified only as 
transgender and no other gender identity. 

• Nonbinary students were those who endorsed a 
nonbinary identity but did not also identify as 
transgender. This group, for which we use the 
umbrella term “nonbinary” to refer to, included 
1) “nonbinary/genderqueer” students who 
identified only as “nonbinary” or “genderqueer,” 
2) “other nonbinary” students who wrote in 
identities outside the gender binary, such as 
“bigender,” “agender,” or “genderfluid,” and 
3) nonbinary students who identified as male or 
female, but not cisgender and not transgender 
(referred to here as “nonbinary male/female”). 

• Questioning students did not identify with any 
other gender category and indicated that they 
were questioning their gender identity.

Across all gender groups, students commonly 
reported feeling unsafe, experiencing high 
frequencies of harassment or assault, and facing 
discrimination at school related to their gender, 
gender expression, and sexual orientation. 
Furthermore, a sizable number of LGBTQ+ 
students across gender groups reported missing 
school and, to a lesser extent, changing schools 
because of safety concerns. In addition, LGBTQ+ 
students of all gender identities reported having 
been disciplined at school. However, there were 
some significant differences among gender groups 
in all of these areas. In this section, we discuss 
the differences in school experiences across 
the broader gender categories of transgender, 
nonbinary, cisgender, and examine the differences 
within each of these four categories. Among 
transgender students, we examine the differences 
between transgender boys, transgender girls, 
transgender nonbinary students, and transgender 
only students. Next, we examine differences 
among nonbinary students, including nonbinary/
genderqueer students, other nonbinary students, 
and nonbinary male/female students. Finally, we 
compare cisgender boys and cisgender girls.

Safety and Victimization

Transgender students were most likely to feel 
unsafe at school because of their gender and 
gender expression than all other students, and 
nonbinary students were more likely to feel 
unsafe for these reasons than were questioning 
and cisgender students (see Figure 3.10).250 
With regard to both in-person victimization and 
online harassment based on gender and gender 
expression, transgender students also experienced 
higher rates than did students of all other gender 
identities, and nonbinary students experienced 
higher rates of such victimization than cisgender 
students and students questioning their gender 
identity (see Figures 3.11 and 3.12).251 Further, 
questioning students were more likely to report 
feeling unsafe because of gender and gender 
expression than were cisgender students. 

With regard to in-person and online harassment 
based on sexual orientation, nonbinary students 
experienced higher rates than did students of all 
other gender identities, and transgender students 
experienced higher rates of this victimization than 
cisgender students. Similarly, nonbinary students 

84

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYreported the highest levels of feeling unsafe at 
school because of their sexual orientation, followed 
by transgender students. Cisgender students 
reported the lowest levels of feeling unsafe because 
of sexual orientation. 

Differences Among Transgender Students. There 
were no differences among transgender students 
in feeling unsafe at school because of their sexual 
orientation. However, feelings of safety about 
gender and gender expression differed among 
transgender students — transgender nonbinary 
students were slightly less likely to feel unsafe 
at school because of their gender than were 
transgender boys (see Figure 3.10).252 Further, 

transgender nonbinary students were less likely 
than transgender male students and transgender 
only students to feel unsafe at school because of 
their gender expression.253

With regard to in-person victimization based on 
sexual orientation, transgender only students 
reported higher rates than transgender nonbinary 
and transgender male students, but did not differ 
from transgender female students. Furthermore, 
there were no differences between transgender 
male and transgender female students regarding 
in-person victimization based on sexual 
orientation (see Figure 3.11).254 Regarding in-
person victimization based on both gender and

reported higher rates than transgender boys and 
transgender nonbinary students, but did not differ 
from transgender girls. Additionally, transgender 
female and transgender male students did not 
differ on in-person victimization based on gender 
and gender expression. However, transgender male 
students reported higher rates than did transgender 
nonbinary students (see also Figure 3.11).255 

Differences among transgender students regarding 
online harassment based on gender and gender 
expression were similar to those found regarding 
in-person victimization (see Figure 3.12). 
Transgender nonbinary students experienced lower 

levels of online harassment based on gender and

transgender only students.256 With regard to online 
harassment based on sexual orientation, the only 
significant difference among transgender students 
was that transgender only students experienced 
higher rates of such harassment than transgender 
nonbinary students.257

Differences Among Nonbinary Students. Similar 
to what we found among transgender students, 
nonbinary students reported similar rates of 
feeling unsafe at school because of their sexual 
orientation.258 However, with regard to feeling unsafe 
because of gender and gender expression, nonbinary

than nonbinary/genderqueer and other nonbinary 
students.259 Further, nonbinary/genderqueer 
students felt more unsafe at school because of 
gender than did other nonbinary students.

Overall, nonbinary students experienced similar 
rates of in-person victimization and online 
harassment based on sexual orientation.260 However, 
there were differences in experiences of in-person 
victimization and online harassment based on 
gender and gender expression. Nonbinary male and 
female students reported lower rates than nonbinary/
genderqueer and other nonbinary students for 
in-person victimization and online harassment 

based on both gender expression and gender.261 In 
addition, nonbinary/genderqueer students reported 
higher rates of online harassment based on gender 
than nonbinary male and female students. 

Differences Among Cisgender Students. Compared 
to cisgender girls, cisgender boys felt more unsafe 
at school because of sexual orientation and gender 
expression262 and experienced more in-person 
victimization based on sexual orientation and 
gender expression.263 However, cisgender girls felt 
more unsafe at school because of their gender and 
experienced higher rates of gender-based in-person 
victimization. Cisgender girls also reported higher 
rates of online harassment based on gender and

Avoiding School Spaces

As shown in the Part 1, School Safety section, 
sizable percentages of LGBTQ+ students avoided 
spaces at school because they felt unsafe or 
uncomfortable, most notably spaces that are 
traditionally segregated by sex, such as bathrooms 
and locker rooms, or spaces where activities that 
segregate by sex take place, such as athletic 
fields or facilities. Overall, transgender and 
nonbinary students were more likely than cisgender 
students to avoid any spaces at school.265 For 
transgender and nonbinary youth, sex-segregated 
spaces at school may be particularly challenging. 
Transgender boys and girls may be prevented 
access to the space that aligns with their gender 
identity and may feel unsafe in the space they 
are allowed to access, as it aligns with their sex 
assigned at birth instead of their gender. Nonbinary 
youth may feel unsafe in any space segregated 
by sex, as neither aligns with their gender.266 For 
these reasons, we examined whether transgender 
and nonbinary students were more likely to avoid 
gendered spaces because they felt unsafe or 
uncomfortable, specifically school bathrooms, 
locker rooms, Gym/Physical Education (PE) class, 
and athletic fields or facilities.267 As shown in 
Figure 3.13, transgender students were more likely 
than all other students, and nonbinary students 
were more likely than cisgender students, to avoid 
these spaces. Compared to cisgender students, 
questioning students were more likely to avoid 
locker rooms, Gym/PE, and sports and athletic 
fields or facilities.

Differences Among Transgender Students. 
Transgender students differed in their avoidance 
of gendered school spaces. Transgender nonbinary 
students were less likely to avoid bathrooms than 
were all other transgender students. Further, 
transgender boys were more likely to avoid these 
spaces than transgender only students, but there 
was no difference between transgender boys 
and transgender girls. Regarding locker rooms, 
transgender boys and transgender girls were more 
likely to avoid these spaces than were transgender 
nonbinary students as seen in Figure 3.13. Finally, 
transgender nonbinary students were also less likely 
than transgender boys to avoid Gym/PE class.268 

Transgender students also avoided certain 
non-gendered school spaces at different rates. 
Specifically, transgender girls avoided the cafeteria 
less than transgender male and transgender only 
students.269 Additionally, transgender girls and 
transgender nonbinary students were less likely to 
avoid certain classrooms (other than PE/Gym class) 
than were transgender only students.270 

Differences Among Nonbinary Students. Nonbinary 
male and female students were less likely to avoid 
gendered spaces, including bathrooms, locker 
rooms, and Gym/PE classes than nonbinary/
genderqueer students.271 Other nonbinary students 
were also more likely to avoid bathrooms than were 
male and female nonbinary students. In addition, 
other nonbinary students also avoided cafeterias 
more than nonbinary/genderqueer students. 

Differences Among Cisgender Students. Cisgender 
boys and girls differed in avoiding spaces for 
safety reasons. Cisgender girls were more likely 
than cisgender boys to avoid spaces that were 
not gendered, including cafeterias, hallways, 
buses, and classrooms (not including Gym/PE).272 
However, cisgender boys were more likely to avoid 
gendered spaces including bathrooms, locker 
rooms, and athletics fields and facilities.273

Educational Attachment and Aspirations

A hostile school climate can affect students’ 
feelings of school belonging, result in students 
avoiding school altogether, and hinder students’ 
overall educational experience. We found that 
transgender students were less likely than other 
students to feel connected to their school, i.e., 
reported lower levels of school belonging, followed 
by nonbinary students. Cisgender students reported 
higher levels of school belonging than all other 
students.274 Transgender and nonbinary students 
were more likely than cisgender and questioning 
students to report missing school because they felt 
unsafe or uncomfortable (see Figure 3.14), and to 
report having changed schools because they felt 
unsafe or uncomfortable.275 Although cisgender 
and questioning students did not differ in rates 
of changing schools, questioning students were 
more likely to have missed school because they felt 
unsafe or uncomfortable than cisgender students. 
Regarding educational aspirations, transgender 
students reported the lowest levels, followed by 
nonbinary students.276 For example, 83.8% of 
transgender and 86.8% of nonbinary students 

88

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYplanned to pursue education beyond high school 
compared to 92.2% of cisgender and 91.4% of 
questioning students.

Differences Among Transgender Students. 
Feelings of school connectedness differed among 
transgender students — transgender boys and 
transgender nonbinary students reported lower 
levels of school belonging than did transgender 
girls and transgender nonbinary students.277 
Transgender only students and transgender boys 
were also more likely than transgender nonbinary 
students and transgender girls to have missed 
school because they felt unsafe or uncomfortable 
(see Figure 3.9).278 Further, transgender boys were 
more likely to change schools for safety reasons 
than were transgender girls and transgender 

nonbinary students (see also Figure 3.14).279 
Finally, transgender boys and transgender only 
students reported lower educational aspirations 
than transgender nonbinary students, and 
transgender boys had lower aspirations than did 
transgender girls.280

Differences Among Nonbinary Students. Although 
nonbinary male and female students and other 
nonbinary students reported similar levels of school 
belonging, nonbinary/genderqueer students felt 
less connected to their school than all other groups 
of nonbinary students.281 Nonbinary/genderqueer 
students also reported lower educational 
aspirations than did nonbinary male and female 
students.282 However, nonbinary students did not 
differ from one another in how often they missed

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYDiscriminatory Policies and Practices

As shown in Figure 3.15, transgender students 
were more likely, overall, to report incidences with 
discriminatory policies and practices286 — 77.9% 
of transgender students reported having been 
discriminated against compared to 57.0% of 
nonbinary students, 43.4% of cisgender students, 
and 51.5% of questioning students. Nonbinary 
students were more likely than cisgender and 
questioning students to report experiencing 
discriminatory policies and practices, and 
questioning students reported experiencing any 
such policies and practices more than cisgender 
students.287 

Certain forms of discrimination are more specific 
to the experiences of transgender and nonbinary 
students, such as being prevented from using 
the bathroom consistent with one’s gender 
identity. Thus, it is not surprising that transgender 
and nonbinary students were more likely to 
report these forms of discrimination than were 
cisgender students.288 Compared to cisgender 
and questioning students, as shown in Table 3.1, 
transgender and nonbinary students were:

• More likely to be required to use the bathroom 

of their sex assigned at birth;

• More likely to be required to use the locker 

room of their sex assigned at birth;

• More likely to be prevented from playing on  

the school sports team that is consistent with 
their gender; 

• More likely to be prevented from using their 

chosen name and pronouns; and

• More likely to be prevented from wearing 
clothing deemed “inappropriate” based  
on gender .

As seen in Table 3.1, transgender students also 
reported more instances of being required to use 
the bathroom and locker room of their legal sex, 
being prevented from playing on the sports team 
that aligns with their gender identity, and being 
prevented from using their chosen name and 
pronouns than nonbinary students.289 However, 
transgender and nonbinary students reported 
similar rates of being prevented from wearing 
clothing deemed “inappropriate” based on gender. 
Further, questioning students were more likely 
to have experienced name and pronouns-based 
discrimination than cisgender students. 

nonbinary students were also more likely than 
cisgender LGBQ students to experience all forms 
of anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination, including broader 
forms of LGBTQ+ discrimination, such as being 
prevented from addressing LGBTQ+ topics in 
class assignments and being unfairly disciplined 
for identifying as LGBTQ+.290 Among LGBTQ+ 
students, it may be that transgender and nonbinary 
students are generally more targeted for discipline 
because they are more visible and/or more 
stigmatized than their peers. Further research is 
needed to explore these disparities and the factors 
that determine which students are most often 
targeted by discriminatory policies and practices.

Differences Among Transgender Students. When 
considering overall experiences with anti-LGBTQ+ 
discriminatory policies and practices, transgender 
girls and transgender nonbinary students were less 
likely to have experienced discriminatory policies 
and practices than transgender only students.291 
Additionally, transgender boys experienced 
more discrimination than transgender girls. 
Further, there were significant differences across 
transgender students when specifically examining 
gender-specific discriminatory policies and 
practices: 

In addition to the specific types of gender-related 
discrimination noted above, transgender and

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYgender, transgender boys and transgender 
only students experienced this kind of 
discrimination more than transgender 
nonbinary students. There was no difference 
between transgender girls and transgender 
boys in gender-based sports discrimination.292 

• Regarding being prevented from using the 
bathroom and locker room that align with 
their gender, transgender only students and 
transgender boys were more likely to report 
these forms of discrimination than were 
transgender nonbinary students (see Table 
3.1).293 

There were, however, no differences across 
transgender students in the rates of being 
prevented from using ones name and pronouns.294

Differences Among Nonbinary Students. Nonbinary/
genderqueer students were more likely than 
male and female nonbinary students to report 
any experiences with discriminatory policies and 
practices.295 Specifically, compared to male and 
female nonbinary students, they experienced 
higher rates of being prevented from using their 
names and pronouns, using the bathroom and 
locker room that align with their gender identity, 
and joining the sports team that aligns with their 
gender identity.296 Nonbinary/genderqueer students 
were also more likely than other nonbinary students 
to report being prevented from using their names 
and pronouns. 

Differences Among Cisgender Students. Overall, 
cisgender girls were more likely to report having 
experienced any discriminatory policies or practices 
at school than were cisgender boys.297 Regarding 
gender-based discrimination, cisgender boys were 
more likely to report being prevented from wearing 
clothing that was deemed inappropriate for their 
gender, and cisgender girls were more likely to 
report being prevented from using their chosen 
names or pronouns and using the locker room that 
aligns with their gender identity.298

Discipline

Experiencing more discriminatory policies and 
practices may in turn lead to higher rates of 
discipline among transgender and nonbinary 
students, as these students may face punishment 
or discipline for breaking school rules. Although 
there were no differences across genders in 

whether they had experienced any discipline 
overall,299 there were some notable differences 
by gender in the specific types of discipline. 
Transgender and nonbinary students were more 
likely than cisgender students to have been sent 
to the principal’s office, received detention, and 
been placed in a room, hallway, or another space in 
the school building alone.300 Among students who 
attended school online at any point in the last year, 
transgender and nonbinary students were more 
likely to have had their participation in their online 
classroom restricted (for example, had their camera 
or mic turned off).301 Additionally, cisgender 
students were less likely than nonbinary students 
to have been removed from their online classroom. 
When examining differences in experiencing 
discipline within our samples of transgender, 
nonbinary, and cisgender students, there were 
no differences, i.e., students of all transgender 
identities experience similar rates of discipline,  
as do all nonbinary and all cisgender students in 
our sample.302

Conclusions

Transgender students, in general, experienced the 
most hostile school climates compared to their 
peers. Among transgender students, transgender 
boys and transgender only students reported 
somewhat more negative school experiences than 
transgender nonbinary students and transgender 
girls. However, regarding certain indicators of 
school climate that we examined, transgender girls 
appeared to have more negative experiences than 
other transgender students, even though these 
differences were not statistically significant. Our 
sample included a small number of transgender 
girls, compared to other gender identities, and 
we may have been unable to detect statistically 
significant difference with this small of a sample. 
Further research is needed to better understand 
the experiences of transgender girls, and to further 
examine the differences in transgender girls’ and 
boys’ school experiences. Additionally, to date no 
research exists examining the experiences of youth 
who identify only as transgender. Considering these 
youth in general experienced the most hostile 
school climates, it is critical that future research 
work to better understand this population.

Nonbinary students who did not also identify 
as transgender had somewhat better school 
experiences than transgender-identified students. 
Among nonbinary students, those who identified as 

93

nonbinary male or nonbinary female experienced 
less hostile climates than those who identified 
only as nonbinary or genderqueer and those with 
other nonbinary identities. Although nonbinary/
genderqueer and other nonbinary students were 
similar on many indicators of school climate, 
nonbinary/genderqueer youth faced more 
discrimination, felt less safe because of their 
gender, and had lower levels of school belonging. 
Further research is needed to examine the many 
different ways youth identify as nonbinary and 
better understand their experiences. 

Although LGBQ cisgender students commonly 
faced hostile school climates, they generally 
experienced fewer negative experiences in school 
than did transgender students and nonbinary 
students. Among LGBQ cisgender students, we 
found that cisgender male students encountered 
a more hostile school climate regarding their 
gender expression and sexual orientation, 
whereas cisgender female students encountered 
a more hostile school climate with regard to their 
gender. Both the bias experienced by cisgender 
male students based on gender expression 
(i.e., stigmatizing boys who are perceived to 
be “feminine”) and the bias experienced by 
cisgender female students based on gender can 
be considered manifestations of misogyny, in that 
they demonstrate hostility towards females and 
femininity. Thus, it is critical that efforts to combat 
victimization and marginalization of LGBTQ+ 
students at school also incorporate efforts to 
combat sexism.

Questioning students differed quite significantly 
from cisgender students as they reported 
significantly worse school experiences. These 
findings suggest that students questioning their 
gender may not be perceived as cisgender by their 
peers and teachers, leading to generally more 
hostile school experiences. When considering 

students who identify as “questioning,” it is also 
important to recognize that it is unknown which 
gender identities they are specifically questioning. 
It could be that these students are questioning 
whether or not they are cisgender. It is also 
possible that they know they are not cisgender, 
but are questioning what their non-cisgender 
identity is (for example, questioning whether they 
are transgender and male or whether they are 
nonbinary). This latter type of questioning could 
help explain why questioning students in our survey 
more frequently reported school experiences that 
were similar to transgender and nonbinary students 
than experiences that were similar to cisgender 
students.

Overall, we found that among the LGBTQ+ 
students in our survey, students whose identities 
do not align with their sex assigned at birth (i.e., 
transgender, nonbinary, genderqueer, and other 
nonbinary-identified students) faced a more 
hostile climate than their cisgender LGBQ peers. 
Our findings also highlight that transgender and 
nonbinary students have less access to education 
than their peers — not only because they feel more 
unsafe and experience more victimization, but also 
because they often have restricted access within 
the school environment itself, specifically, a lack of 
access to sex segregated spaces. School staff need 
to be aware of the various ways that sex-segregated 
spaces may be particularly difficult for transgender 
and nonbinary youth to navigate, and should work 
to ensure that all students have equal access to 
school facilities. Educators must also be mindful 
that improving school climate for transgender and 
nonbinary students goes beyond ensuring that they 
can access school facilities like bathrooms and 
locker rooms. They must work to be inclusive and 
affirming of transgender and nonbinary students 
in their teaching and in their interactions with 
transgender and nonbinary students.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYSCHOOL CLIMATE AND RACIAL/ETHNIC IDENTITY

As discussed previously in this report, many 
LGBTQ+ students feel unsafe at school or face 
identity-based victimization related to a variety 
of personal characteristics, including race and 
ethnicity. Furthermore, for students with multiple 
marginalized identities, such as LGBTQ+ youth 
of color, multiple forms of oppression may 
interact with and affect one another.303 For 
example, the racism that an LGBTQ+ student 
of color experiences at school may impact the 
homophobia or transphobia that they experience, 
and vice versa.304 Thus, we examined school 
climate for different racial/ethnic groups305 of 
LGBTQ+ students in our survey: Arab American, 
Middle Eastern, and North African (MENA); Asian 
American, Pacific Islander, and Native Hawaiian 
(AAPI); Black; Latinx;306 Native American, 
American Indian, and Alaska Native (referred 
to as “Native and Indigenous” in this section); 
multiracial; and White students. Specifically, we 
examined safety and victimization related to sexual 
orientation, gender expression, and race/ethnicity. 
We further examined how anti-LGBTQ+ bias may 
manifest for different racial/ethnic groups by also 
examining their experiences with anti-LGBTQ+ 
discriminatory school policies and practices. 
Given previous research that indicates some youth 
of color may be disproportionately targeted by 
school staff for disciplinary action, as compared to 
their White peers,307 we also examined students’ 
experiences with school disciplinary action, 
including any school discipline and contact with 
the criminal justice system as a result of school 
discipline. Finally, we examine experiences of 
educational attainment and aspirations.

Throughout this section, we examine differences 
among LGBTQ+ students by race/ethnicity. 
When examining differences between groups, we 
considered factors that may also impact students’ 
school experiences. For example, previous 
research has shown that being out about one’s 
LGBTQ+ identity at school relates to greater peer 
victimization.308 We found that outness varied by 
race/ethnicity.309 For example, AAPI students were 
less likely to be out to both their peers and school 
staff than their peers of other racial/ethnics groups 
(see Figure 3.16). Because such differences in 
outness may impact students’ school experiences, 
we account for these and other demographic, 
student body racial composition, and school 
characteristics in our analyses, as appropriate. 

Feelings of Safety at School 

As noted in Part One, many LGBTQ+ students 
feel unsafe at school for various personal 
characteristics. Overall, we found that feeling 
unsafe due to sexual orientation, gender 
expression, gender, and race differed between 
racial/ethnic groups (see Figure 3.17):310 

• Black and AAPI students were less likely 

to report feeling unsafe due to their sexual 
orientation than their white, Latinx, and 
multiracial peers.

• Black and AAPI students were less likely 

to report feeling unsafe due to their gender 
expression than white, Latinx, Native and 
Indigenous, and multiracial students. Black

• Black and AAPI students were less likely to 

report feeling unsafe due to their gender than 
white, Latinx, and multiracial students.

• Black students were more likely than most 

other students to feel unsafe due to their race/
ethnicity, except for AAPI and Native and 
Indigenous students. Not surprisingly, white 
students were far more likely to feel unsafe 
because of the race/ethnicity at school than all 
other students.

Victimization

In our survey we found that a majority of all 
LGBTQ+ students reported experiencing some form 
of in-person victimization, based on either sexual 
orientation, gender expression, gender, or race/

ethnicity.311 Notably, LGBTQ+ students differed 
by racial/ethnic groups on their experiences with 
anti-LGBTQ+ victimization, i.e., based sexual 
orientation, gender expression, gender,312 and on 
victimization based on race/ethnicity313 (see

the highest rates of in-person victimization 
based on gender than all others, and 
multiracial students reported higher rates than 
white and Black students.

• Over half of all LGBTQ+ students of color 

experienced in-person victimization based on 
race/ethnicity.

multiracial students.

LGBTQ+ students’ experiences of online 
harassment also differed based on their race/
ethnicity (see Figure 3.19):314 Native and 
Indigenous students reported the highest levels 

of online harassment based on sexual orientation, 
gender expression, and gender, and Latinx students 
reported higher levels than white, AAPI and Black 
students. Multiracial students reported higher 
levels of online harassment based on sexual 
orientation and gender than Black and AAPI 
students, and higher levels of online harassment

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYDiscipline

Prior research suggests that youth of color may be 
at a higher risk of experiencing school discipline 
than their white peers, however, fewer studies have 
examined differences within youth of color, as well 
as looking specifically at LGBTQ+ youth of color. 
Therefore, we examined whether rates of school 
discipline varied based on students’ race/ethnicity 
among the students in our survey. We found that 
many of the race/ethnicity groups reported similar 
rates of school discipline (see Figure 3.21). 317 
However, AAPI students reported experiencing 
less school discipline than students from all other 
racial/ethnic groups except for MENA students. 
In addition, white students reported less school 
discipline than Latinx and multiracial students.

Similar to discipline, current narratives suggest 
that students of color may have disproportionately 
high interactions, and disproportionately negative 
interactions, with school security personnel.318 
For this reason, we examined the frequency of 
interaction with security personnel, the quality 
of interaction with security personnel, and how 
safe students felt at school because of security 
personnel. In our survey, we found that there were 
no significant differences in these experiences by 
racial/ethnic group. 

Educational Attachment and Aspirations

A hostile school climate can affect students’ 
feelings of school belonging, result in students 
avoiding school altogether, and hinder students’ 
overall educational experience. Students may miss 

school entirely if they feel unsafe there, and some 
may even change schools entirely because of the 
hostile school climate. Furthermore, they may feel 
less connected to their school community and less 
interested in pursuing post-secondary education. 
For these reasons, we examined students’ 
experiences with missing and changing schools 
because of safety reasons, feelings of school 
belonging, and their educational aspirations. 

White students missed fewer days of school for 
safety reasons than Latinx students and Native and 
Indigenous students, and AAPI students missed 
fewer days of school than most other students, 
except for White and Black students (see Figure 
3.22).319 We found that, overall, students of 
different races/ethnicities reported having had to 
change schools in the past because of safety reasons 
at similar rates. However, AAPI students were 
less likely than Latinx and Native and Indigenous 
students to have changed schools for safety 
reasons (see also Figure 3.22).320 We found that 
Native and Indigenous students had lower levels of 
school belonging than students of all other races/
ethnicities, and AAPI students had higher school 
belonging than white, Native and Indigenous, Latinx 
and multiracial students (see Figure 3.23).321 With 
regard to educational aspirations, overall students of 
different racial/ethnic groups reported similar rates 
of planning to pursue post-secondary education . 
However, Native and Indigenous students reported 
lower rates of planning to pursue post-secondary 
school than AAPI and MENA students and AAPI 
students reported higher rates than did Native and 
Indigenous, Black and Latinx students (see also 
Figure 3.23).322

Conclusions 

The majority of LGBTQ+ students of all races and 
ethnicities reported hostile school experiences 
due to their marginalized identities. Nevertheless, 
we observed some notable relationships between 
racial/ethnic identity and feelings of safety as well 
as experiences of victimization, discrimination, 
disciplinary action, and educational attainment and 
aspiration in school. Overall, we found that Native 
and Indigenous LGBTQ+ students experienced 
more hostile school climates than their peers of 
other racial/ethnic groups in many areas. Native 
and Indigenous students experienced higher rates 
of victimization based on sexual orientation, gender 
expression, gender, and race/ethnicity than almost 
all other students, with the exception of MENA 
students, specifically concerning victimization 
based on sexual orientation. Native and Indigenous 

students also reported poorer outcomes when 
considering their feelings about education as they 
reported the lowest levels of school belonging 
compared to students of all other races/ethnicities. 
Conversely, Black and AAPI LGBTQ+ students were 
both generally less likely than others to have had 
anti-LGBTQ+ experiences at school; they were less 
likely than many of their peers to report feeling 
unsafe due to their sexual orientation, gender 
expression and gender, and they reported less 
experiences of anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination than 
many of their peers. Additionally, AAPI students 
reported the lowest rates of discipline and were 
less likely to report missing or changing schools 
than many of their peers of other races/ethnicities. 
AAPI students also reported higher school 
belonging and were more likely to report that they 
planned to pursue post-secondary education than 
many of their peers. It is unclear why anti-LGBTQ+ 

100

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYexperiences differ across racial/ethnic groups 
in this way, and further research is warranted 
regarding the relationship between racial/ethnic 
identity and anti-LGBTQ+ school experiences. 
Although we accounted for the racial composition 
of the schools in our analyses, it may be that some 
of these differences are related to variations across 
racial/ethnic groups in other characteristics of the 
schools that they attend.

Despite the differences that we found, it is 
important to acknowledge that, overall, all LGBTQ+ 
youth of color were at greater risk of experiencing 
multiple forms of victimization than their 
White LGBTQ+ peers.323 Furthermore, our prior 

research has shown that LGBTQ+ youth of color 
who experienced both racist and anti-LGBTQ+ 
victimization at school reported the poorest 
well-being, and are most likely to feel unsafe at 
school, compared to those who experienced one 
or neither form of victimization.324 Thus, school 
staff must support LGBTQ+ youth of color with an 
intersectional approach that acknowledges and 
responds to racism, homophobia, and transphobia, 
and to the ways these intersecting forms of 
oppression may influence one another. Further 
research is needed to critically examine how school 
climate manifests for LGBTQ+ students of different 
racial and ethnic backgrounds, as well as best 
practices to serve these populations of youth.

101

SCHOOL CLIMATE BY SCHOOL CHARACTERISTICS

LGBTQ+ students’ experiences at school with 
regard to safety and LGBTQ+-related supports may 
vary depending on the characteristics of the school 
itself. Students in our survey were asked about 
their grade level, type of school they attend, and 
geographic location of their school. We examined 
potential differences in LGBTQ+ students’ reports 
of hearing anti-LGBTQ+ language, experiences of 
anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and discrimination,  
and access to LGBTQ+-related resources and 
supports by school level, school type, locale,  
and geographic region.

Differences by School Level

Experiences of Hostile School Climate. We 
examined differences in the experiences of 
LGBTQ+ students in middle school (5th-8th 
grade) and high school (9th-12th grade). Overall, 
we found that LGBTQ+ middle school students 
reported a more hostile school climate than 
LGBTQ+ high school students. Compared to  
high school students, middle school students:

• Heard “that’s so gay” more frequently than 
LGBTQ+ students in high school (There was 
no difference in hearing other anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks) (see Table 3.2);325

• Experienced higher levels of all types of  
in-person anti-LGBTQ+ victimization,  
including victimization based on sexual 
orientation, gender expression, and gender  
(see Table 3.2);326

• Experienced higher levels of online 

harassment, including victimization based  
on sexual orientation, gender expression,  
and gender (see Table 3.2);327 and

• Were more likely to experience anti-LGBTQ+ 
discriminatory school policies and practices 
(see Table 3.2).328

and nonbinary students. Middle school students 
reported having fewer supportive educators, a less 
supportive school administration, and fewer visible 
signs of LGBTQ+ support in school, specifically 
Safe Space stickers/posters. In addition, LGBTQ+ 
students in middle school were less likely than 
those in high school to report having LGBTQ+-
inclusive curriculum and LGBTQ+-inclusive 
materials and resources outside of classroom 
instruction, such as website access, library 
resources, and textbooks/other assigned readings. 
However, middle school students were more likely 
than high school students to report that they 
had had LGBTQ+ inclusive sex education. Sex 
education often begins in middle school. Therefore, 
it is possible that middle school students reported 
higher rates of LGBTQ+ inclusive sex education 
because they had been taught the information 
more recently and could recall the information 
more readily than high school students who may 
have had sex education classes longer ago. It 
may also be that as sex education curricula and 
programs become more inclusive of LGBTQ+ 
topics, younger students would be more likely 
to receive such new curricula and instruction, 
whereas older students may have been less likely to 
receive the more current and inclusive content.  

Middle school students were also less likely to 
report that their school had a supportive student 
club, such as a GSA. However, among LGBTQ+ 
students who had a GSA in their school, those 
in middle school reported attending meetings 
more often.330 It may be that LGBTQ+ students in 
middle school are more likely than those in high 
school to seek support at GSA meetings, given 
the comparatively more hostile school climate in 
middle school. It is also possible that there are 
fewer extracurricular activities available in middle 
schools compared to high schools, and therefore 
middle school students may less commonly have 
to choose between going to their GSA and going to 
another activity.

LGBTQ+-Related Resources and Supports. 
LGBTQ+ students in middle school were less likely 
to have access to LGBTQ+-related resources and 
supports in school, as compared to those in high 
school (see also Table 3.2).329 LGBTQ+ middle 
school students were less likely to report having 
both comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment 
policies and policies supportive of transgender 

Overall, these findings are consistent with research 
on the general population which indicates that 
middle school students in general face more 
hostile climates than high school students.331 
School districts should devote greater attention to 
implementing these LGBTQ+-supportive resources 
in middle schools and to addressing anti-LGBTQ+ 
bias in younger grades, before it becomes 

102

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYengrained in middle school students’ behaviors and 
attitudes. With specific regard to school policies, 
given that comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment 
policies and supportive policies for transgender 
and nonbinary students are often mandated at the 
district level, one would not necessarily expect any 
differences by school level. It may be that younger 
students are less aware of protective policies at 

their schools, and as such, school districts may 
need to increase efforts to educating students at 
all school levels about their rights. It also might 
reflect that some districts are inconsistent in the 
implementation of policies among their schools, 
particularly middle schools, and in such cases, 
districts must ensure that all schools are following 
district policies about school climate.

Differences by School Type

We examined differences in the experiences of 
LGBTQ+ students in public schools, religious 
schools, and private non-religious schools. Overall, 
we found that LGBTQ+ students in private non-
religious schools experienced the least hostile 
school climate.

Biased Language. Overall, we found that LGBTQ+ 
students from private schools were less likely than 
students from public and religious schools to hear 
any LGBTQ+-biased language at school (see Table 
3.3).332 LGBTQ+ students in public schools and in 
religious schools heard “gay” used in a negative 
way and negative remarks about transgender 
people at similar rates. However, public school 
students were in general more likely that religious 
school students to have heard homophobic remarks 
overall, whereas students in religious schools heard 
more negative remarks about gender expression 
compared to students in public school. 

Among public school students, we also examined 
anti-LGBTQ+ language between students in charter 
schools and those in regular public schools. 
Students in public schools reported higher rates 
of hearing “gay” used in a negative way, other 
homophobic remarks, and negative remarks  
about transgender people (see also Table 3.3). 
However, for “no homo” and negative remarks 
about gender expression, we did not observe any 
differences.333

Peer Victimization. The frequency of in-person 
anti-LGBTQ+ victimization also differed across 
school type (see also Table 3.3).334 LGBTQ+ 
students in public schools generally experienced 
higher levels of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization than 
others. Public school students experienced higher 
levels of all types of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization 
than those in private schools, and higher levels 
of victimization based on sexual orientation and 
gender than those in religious schools. However, 
public school and religious school students did not 
differ on victimization based on gender expression. 
Private school students and religious school 
students did not differ on any type of anti-LGBTQ+ 
victimization. In regard to online harassment, 
overall, students in all types of schools experienced 
similar rates of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization.335 
Furthermore, among public school students, there 
were no significant differences with regard to in-
person victimization or online harassment between 

those in charter schools and those in regular public 
schools (see Table 3.3).336

Anti-LGBTQ+ Discrimination. Students in religious 
school were more likely than those in private and 
public schools to report experiencing anti-LGBTQ+ 
discriminatory school policies and practices, and 
there were no differences between students in 
private school and in students in public schools 
(see also Table 3.3).337 Furthermore, among 
public school students, there were no significant 
differences in experiences with discrimination 
between those in charter schools and those in 
regular public schools (see also Table 3.3).338 

LGBTQ+-Related Resources and Supports. We 
examined differences by school type regarding 
LGBTQ+ students’ access to LGBTQ+-related 
school supports, including: GSAs, supportive staff, 
LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum, other curricular 
resources, and inclusive and supportive school 
policies. Overall, students in religious schools 
were less likely to report having LGBTQ+-related 
resources and supports in their schools, and 
students in private schools were more likely to report 
having these resources and supports (see Table 
3.3).339 Additionally, students in charter schools 
in general had greater access to resources and 
supports than those in regular public schools.340 
Charter school students reported greater access to 
LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum, including inclusive 
sex education, comprehensive anti-bullying/
harassment policies, supportive transgender 
and nonbinary policies, inclusive textbooks, and 
supportive administrators. However, students in 
regular private schools were more likely to report 
having access to GSAs, Safe Space stickers, and 
library resources inclusive of LGBTQ+ content.

Students in private non-religious schools were 
generally most likely to have LGBTQ+-related 
supportive school resources. However, students 
in private schools did not differ from students in 
religious schools regarding access to LGBTQ+-
related textbooks, and also did not differ from 
students in public schools regarding library 
resources, supportive educators, visible displays 
of support (i.e., Safe Space stickers/posters), and 
LGBTQ+ library resources. Additionally, students in 
private schools were slightly less likely than those 
in public schools to have access to a GSA. 

In contrast to private schools, students in religious 
schools were generally less likely to report having 

104

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYmost supportive school resources. Religious 
school students had less access than all other 
students to: GSAs, supportive educators and 
school administration, protective school policies, 
LGBTQ+-inclusive curriculum including LGBTQ+-
inclusive sex education, and LGBTQ+ information 
on school computers and from the school library. 
However, we also found that LGBTQ+ students 
in religious schools were more likely to have 
LGBTQ+-related information in textbooks or other 
assigned readings than public school students, 
and as previously mentioned, were not different 
from private school students in their access to 
these types of resources. Furthermore, religious 
school students were most likely to report negative 
representations of LGBTQ+ people and topics in 
their curriculum (see Table 3.5).341 

It is perhaps surprising that LGBTQ+ students from 
religious schools reported more LGBTQ+ content 
in their textbooks or other assigned readings than 
public school students. However, students in the 
survey were asked about any LGBTQ+ inclusion 
in textbooks and assigned readings, regardless of 
its nature. Considering the finding that religious 
school students were more likely than others to 
report being taught negative LGBTQ+ content, it 
is possible that the LGBTQ+ topics included in 
students’ textbooks and assigned readings are 
often included in a negative manner.

Within public schools, students in charter schools 
reported greater access to LGBTQ+-inclusive 
curricular instruction, comprehensive anti-bullying/
harassment policies, transgender and nonbinary 
student policies, supportive administration, 
and LGBTQ+ inclusion in textbooks or assigned 
reading. In contrast, students in public school were 
more likely to report having access to GSAs, visual 
signs of support, and LGBTQ+ library resources. 
Students in charter schools and regular public 
schools did not differ on access to supportive 
educators or LGBTQ+ website access. 

In general, we found that private schools were 
more positive environments for LGBTQ+ youth 
than public or religious schools, as private school 
students were least likely to hear anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks and were most likely to have LGBTQ+-
related school resources and supports. The 
differences between LGBTQ+ student experiences 
in religious schools and those in public schools, 
however, are more nuanced. Students in religious 
schools were less likely than those in public 

schools to hear “no homo,” other homophobic 
remarks and to experience victimization based 
on sexual orientation and gender. However, they 
were more likely to hear negative remarks about 
gender expression, experience LGBTQ+-related 
discrimination at school, and less likely to have 
LGBTQ+ resources and supports. These findings 
may indicate that traditional gender role behavior 
is more policed and enforced in religious schools 
than in other types of schools. Although students 
in religious schools heard most biased remarks less 
frequently than those in public school, they heard 
more negative remarks about gender expression 
than students in public schools. Additionally, 
regarding victimization, students in religious 
schools experienced less victimization based on 
sexual orientation and gender than did students 
in public school, but the two groups experienced 
similar rates of victimization based on gender 
expression. This strict enforcement of gender 
norms and roles may also account for our finding 
that students in religious schools experienced more 
discriminatory policies and practices than other 
students, as many of these policies and practices 
are about adherence to gender norms and binary 
gender division.  

It is important to note that all private schools, 
both religious and non-religious, can select who 
attends their school and can more easily expel 
students than public schools, which could result 
in comparatively lower rates of harassment 
experienced by LGBTQ+ students in private 
non-religious and religious schools. However, the 
policies and practices of some religious schools 
may reflect a more negative, anti-LGBTQ+ attitude 
of their specific religious doctrine or beliefs, which 
in turn, may result in greater LGBTQ+-related 
discrimination and fewer supports.

Despite the differences we found between public, 
religious, and private non-religious schools, 
we found that LGBTQ+ students in all three 
school types commonly reported experiences 
of anti-LGBTQ+ remarks, victimization, and 
discrimination. For all types of schools, more 
effort needs to be made to provide positive school 
environments for LGBTQ+ youth. With specific 
regard to religious schools, greater efforts toward 
providing more inclusive curricular resources and 
policies for LGBTQ+ students are specifically 
warranted. In addition, given that little is known 
about the expulsion of LGBTQ+ students in private 
schools, further research is needed to better

actions might affect school climate for LGBTQ+ 
students. 

There were no differences in experiences of this 
kind of discrimination between students in urban 
schools and students in suburban schools (see 
Table 3.4).345

Among students in public schools, specifically, 
those in charter schools were generally similar 
to those in regular public schools with regard to 
anti-LGBTQ+ experiences. With regard to LGBTQ+-
related resources and supports, however, students 
in charter schools were generally more likely to 
have more supportive resources. More research 
is needed to understand these differences in 
resources and supports between charter schools 
and regular public schools. With increased 
attention paid to charter schools in recent years, 
it is also important that future research further 
examine the experiences of LGBTQ+ students in 
these schools. As charter schools may vary widely 
in their missions, ideals, and practices, further 
exploration into how various types of charter 
schools address LGBTQ+ student issues would be 
particularly valuable.

Differences by Locale

We examined differences in the experiences of 
LGBTQ+ students in urban, suburban, and rural 
schools. Overall, we found that LGBTQ+ students 
in rural schools experienced the most hostile 
school climates.

Biased Language. LGBTQ+ students in rural 
schools reported hearing all types of anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks more frequently than those in urban and 
suburban schools, and there were no differences 
between students in urban and those in suburban 
schools (see Table 3.4).342 

LGBTQ+-Related Resources and Supports. As also 
shown in Table 3.4, students from rural schools 
had less access to all LGBTQ+-related resources 
and supports than students in urban and suburban 
schools.346 In general, students in suburban 
schools had more access to LGBTQ+-inclusive 
resources than students in urban schools. However, 
suburban and urban schools did not differ on 
comprehensive policies, transgender/nonbinary 
student policies, LGBTQ+ website access, 
LGBTQ+-related library resources, LGBTQ+-
inclusive textbooks and reading materials, and 
supportive administration.

Overall, our findings indicate that schools in rural 
areas were the most unsafe and were least likely 
to have LGBTQ+-related school resources and 
supports. Although schools in suburban areas 
appeared to be safest for LGBTQ+ students, they 
sometimes did not differ from urban schools with 
regard to certain resources and supports. More 
research is needed to examine the relationship 
between school supports and their effect on 
school climate for LGBTQ+ students, particularly 
while taking into account differences by locale. 
Nevertheless, given the positive impact of 
LGBTQ+-related school resources and supports, 
specific efforts should be made to increase these 
resources in all schools, and particularly in rural 
schools where there may be the greatest need.

Differences by Region

Peer Victimization. LGBTQ+ students in 
suburban schools experienced less anti-LGBTQ+ 
victimization and harassment both in-person343 and 
online344 compared to students in other locales 
(see Table 3.4). LGBTQ+ students in urban schools 
were less likely to experience in-person anti-
LGBTQ+ victimization than those in rural schools 
and less online harassment based on sexual 
orientation and gender compared to students in 
rural schools. However, urban and rural students 
did not differ in how often they experienced online 
harassment based on gender expression.

Anti-LGBTQ+ Discrimination. LGBTQ+ students in 
rural schools were more likely to experience anti-
LGBTQ+ discrimination than those in other locales. 

We examined differences in experiences of 
LGBTQ+ students in the South, Midwest, West, 
and Northeast. In general, LGBTQ+ students from 
the South and Midwest reported more hostile 
school climates than students from the West and 
Northeast.

Biased Language. Overall, LGBTQ+ students 
from the South were more likely to hear all forms 
of anti-LGBTQ+ language, with the exception 
of negative remarks about transgender people, 
which they heard at similar rates as students 
in the Midwest.347  Students in the Northeast 
and West were least likely to hear anti-LGBTQ+ 
language (see Table 3.5), and heard other 
homophobic remarks, negative remarks about

transgender people at similar rates. However, 
students in the Northeast were least likely, 
compared to students in all other regions, to hear 
“gay” used in a negative way, and “no homo.” In 
general, students in the Midwest heard biased 
language less frequently than students in the 
South, but at greater rates than those in the West 
and Northeast, with the exception of “no homo,” 
which students in the West and Midwest heard at 
similar rates.  

Peer Victimization. Overall, LGBTQ+ students 
from the Northeast reported the lowest levels of 
in-person anti-LGBTQ+ victimization, compared 
to students from all other regions (see also Table 
3.5).348 In contrast, LGBTQ+ students from the 
South and Midwest generally experienced higher 
levels of in-person anti-LGBTQ+ victimization 
than students from all other regions. Specifically, 
in-person victimization based on sexual orientation 
was highest among students in the South and 
Midwest, and lowest among students in the 
Northeast, and students in the West experienced 
these types of victimization at lower rates than 
those in the West and Midwest. With regard to in-
person victimization based on gender and gender 
expression, students in the Northeast reported the 
lowest rates, and students in the West reported 
lower rates than those in the South. For the most 
part, students in the Northeast reported less online 
anti-LGBTQ+ harassment than students in other 
regions, and there were few differences among 
students in the South, Midwest, and West.

Anti-LGBTQ+ Discrimination. Students from 
the Northeast were least likely to experience 
anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory school policies and 
practices, followed by students from the West, and 
then students from the Midwest (see also Table 
3.5).349 Students from the South were the most 
likely to experience anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory 
school policies and practices, compared to all  
other regions.

LGBTQ+-Related Resources and Supports. 
Students from the South were the least likely to 
report having access to all resources and supports 
than all other regions, and students from the 

Northeast were more likely to report having access 
to most LGBTQ+-related school resources and 
supports than all other regions, and (see also Table 
3.5).350 Students in the Northeast were more likely 
than those in the Midwest to have access to all 
resources and supports that we examined. Students 
in the Northeast also were more likely than those 
in the West to report having supportive school 
personnel, LGBTQ+ website access, LGBTQ+ 
library resources, LGBTQ+-related textbooks and 
other readings, and supportive transgender and 
nonbinary policies, but they did not differ regarding 
curricular inclusion, GSAs, and comprehensive 
antibullying/harassment policies. Students in the 
Northeast, however, were less likely than those in 
the West to have received sex education that was 
inclusive of LGBTQ+ topics. Students in the West 
were more likely to report having all resources and 
supports compared to students in the Midwest, 
except for that they were not different in access to 
LGBTQ+-related textbooks/other assigned readings. 

Overall, LGBTQ+ students in the South and 
Midwest faced more negative school climates 
and less access to LGBTQ+-related resources and 
supports, compared to those in the Northeast and 
West. These regional findings highlight that much 
more needs to be done to ensure that LGBTQ+ 
students are safe regardless of where in the United 
States they attend school, and that education 
leaders and safe school advocates must pay 
particular attention to schools in regions where 
LGBTQ+ students experience a more hostile school 
climate. Given that attitudes about LGBTQ+ people 
are less positive in the South and Midwest,351 
and recent legislative battles over LGBTQ+ rights 
in schools, including anti-LGBTQ+ curriculum 
bills in many Southern and Midwestern states,352 
further inquiry is needed on how best to implement 
LGBTQ+ resources and supports in schools in 
more conservative regions, in spite of cultural and 
political beliefs towards the LGBTQ+ community. 
Furthermore, national efforts regarding bullying 
prevention and positive school climate must not 
only take into account the overall experiences of 
LGBTQ+ students, but they must also acknowledge 
and respond to regional differences regarding 
anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and access to LGBTQ+ 
student supports.

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY 
Conclusions 

Overall, schools nationwide are not safe learning 
environments for LGBTQ+ students and are lacking 
in LGBTQ+ resources and supports, and they differ, 
often significantly, by school and geographical 
characteristics. By and large, the majority of 
LGBTQ+ students in middle schools, from schools 
in rural areas, and from schools in the South and 
Midwest experience more hostile school climate, 
and have less access to LGBTQ+-related resources 
and supports. 

With regard to school type, the picture of school 
climate for LGBTQ+ students is more complex. It is 
evident from our findings that private non-religious 
schools were safer and had more supportive 
resources for LGBTQ+ students than religious 
and public schools. However, the differences 
between religious and public schools were more 
nuanced. LGBTQ+ students in religious schools 
were less likely to hear anti-LGBTQ+ remarks and 
experienced less victimization based on sexual 
orientation and gender than those in public 
schools, but were more likely to experience anti-
LGBTQ+ discriminatory policies and practices. 
However, students in public schools had more 
positive LGBTQ+ supports and resources. Thus, 
religious schools may be physically safer but not 
supportive or equitable learning environments 
for LGBTQ+ students. It is also important to note 
that compared to regular public schools, private, 
religious, and charter schools can more easily expel 
or remove students who engage in behaviors that 
make school climates hostile for other students, 
such as bullying, harassment, and making biased 
remarks, which may in turn decrease the rates of 
these experiences in their schools. 

To date, there is no federal legislation that 
has explicitly established protections from 
discrimination in schools based on sexual 

orientation and gender identity. Although Title 
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (Title 
IX) prohibits discrimination based on sex in 
federally-funded schools, federal administrative 
policy has been inconsistent in communicating 
that discrimination based on sex includes 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity. (Recently, however, the U.S. 
Department of Education has proposed a revised 
rule that expressly states that Title IX prohibits 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity, including harassment that creates 
a hostile environment.353) Furthermore, private 
religious schools may be eligible for an exemption 
from fully applying Title IX,354 which may allow 
these schools to discriminate against LGBTQ+ 
students without the same legal ramifications  
as public, charter, and federally-funded non-
religious schools.355 

Despite some recent progress in legislation, federal 
legislation is necessary to ensure nondiscrimination 
protections are not rolled back under a future 
presidential administration. Given the lack of 
consistent federal protections from anti-LGBTQ+ 
discrimination for LGBTQ+ students, along with 
our findings regarding LGBTQ+ youth in religious 
schools, it is evident that focused legislative 
efforts must be made to provide positive school 
environments for LGBTQ+ youth in these schools. 
Efforts should be made to ensure that schools are 
safe and welcoming for all students across these 
school characteristics, while paying particular 
attention to school characteristics with the most 
hostile school climate. Furthermore, efforts 
should be made to ensure that LGBTQ+ students 
are provided with access to affirming LGBTQ+ 
resources and supports, with particular attention 
to the types or locations of schools with the least 
resources and supports.

PART FOUR: 
INDICATORS OF 
SCHOOL CLIMATE 
OVER TIME

GLSEN strives to make schools safe for all 
students, regardless of their sexual orientation, 
gender identity or expression, race or ethnicity, 
or any other characteristic that may be the basis 
for harassment. Given that the National School 
Climate Survey (NSCS) is the only study that has 
continually assessed the school experiences of 
LGBTQ+ students, it is vital that we use our data 
to examine changes over time in the education 
landscape for this population. In this section, we 
examine whether there have been changes from 
2001 to the present 2021 survey356 in indicators 
of a hostile school climate, such as hearing 
homophobic remarks, experiences of harassment 
and assault, and experiences of discriminatory 
school policies and practices. We also examine 
the availability of positive resources for LGBTQ+ 
students in their schools such as supportive 
educators, student-led clubs such as GSAs 
(Gay-Straight Alliances or Gender and Sexuality 
Alliances), inclusive curricular resources, and 
comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment policies. 
In addition, we examine whether there have been 
changes over time in students’ acceptance of 
LGBTQ+ people.

Across the years, the survey has been slightly 
modified with each installment to reflect new 
or emerging concerns about school climate for 
LGBTQ+ students, but its content has remained 
largely the same and has used virtually the same 
data collection methods since 2001.  However, 
the most current data is from the 2020–2021 
academic year, when schools had to respond to the 
COVID pandemic. Thus, we also had to adapt and 
modify our survey questions accordingly to capture 

changes in school structures and instructional 
methods, as discussed in the “Methods” section of 
this report. It is important to note that comparisons 
across years in anti-LGBTQ+ remarks, feelings of 
safety at school, experiences of discrimination, 
and the availability of LGBTQ+ resources at 
school include the full 2021 sample, regardless 
of the type of learning environment they were in. 
However, experiences of victimization include only 
those students from the 2021 survey who had 
been in school in-person at some time during the 
2020–2021 academic year. 

Anti-LGBTQ+ Remarks Over Time

Language perpetually evolves, and so is the 
case with anti-LGBTQ+ remarks since we began 
conducting the NSCS. To keep current with changes 
in usage, we have modified how we ask LGBTQ+ 
students about anti-LGBTQ+ remarks. In 2001, 
we assessed the frequency of hearing homophobic 
remarks, either remarks like “fag” or “dyke,” but 
also expressions using “gay” to mean something bad 
or valueless. In 2003, we began asking questions 
about hearing negative remarks about gender 
expression, such as someone acting not “feminine 
enough” or “masculine enough.” In 2009, we 
began assessing the expression “no homo,” and in 
2013 we asked about negative expressions about 
transgender people, such as “tranny” or “he/she.”

• Homophobic remarks were on the decline 

from 2001 to 2015, and remained consistent 
from 2015 to 2017, However, in 2019, the 
frequency of remarks declined and remained 
static in 2021 (see Figure 4.1).357

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY• Use of expressions such as “that’s so gay” has 
remained the most common form of biased 
language heard by LGBTQ+ students in school. 
These remarks had consistently declined until 
2015, but increased from 2015 to 2019 and 
remained at a similar level in 2021 (see also 
Figure 4.1).358 

• Hearing homophobic remarks from teachers or 
schools staff decreased from 2007 to 2013, 
was unchanged from 2013 to 2017, and then 
decreased further in 2019. In 2021, however, 
the frequency of staff making homophobic 
remarks increased and was higher than most 
recent years starting with 2013;362

• Hearing the expression “no homo” had 

• Hearing negative remarks about gender 

consistently been less common than most 
other types of LGBTQ+-related biased remarks, 
and the frequency had been on a decline from 
2011 to 2017. However, in 2019, we saw a 
sizeable increase from 2017, and remained at 
a similar level in 2021.359 

expression from school staff had a downward 
trend in frequency between 2003 and 2013, 
yet an upward trend from 2013 to 2017, and 
decreased again in 2019. In 2021, these 
remarks increased and were more common 
than in most prior years.363 

• Hearing negative remarks about gender 

expression had not changed in frequency 
across years between 2003 and 2011, but 
decreased from 2011 to 2013. These remarks 
increased in 2015 but declined in 2017 and 
again in 2019. In 2021, the frequency of 
remarks was higher than in 2019, but lower 
than all years prior to that.360

• Negative remarks about transgender people 
had steadily increased from 2013, when 
we first asked this question, to 2017, but 
decreased in 2019 and remained at a similar 
level in 2021.361

As shown in Figure 4.2, since 2001, the majority 
of students have reported that they have heard 
anti-LGBTQ+ remarks from teachers or other staff 
in their school: 

Intervention in Anti-LGBTQ+ Remarks  
Over Time

In our 2001 survey, we began asking students how 
frequently people in their school intervened when 
hearing homophobic remarks (see Figure 4.3): 

• Rates of intervention by staff were relatively 

similar across years between 2001 and 2013, 
but declined from 2013 to 2015, remained at 
a similar lower level from 2015 to 2019, and 
decreased again in 2021, when it was at the 
lowest rate of all years.364

• Rates of intervention by other students had 
largely been decreasing in the early years of 
the survey through 2013, but increased from 
2013 to 2015. The rate then decreased in 
2017 and again in 2019. In 2021, however,

In our 2003 survey, we began asking students how 
frequently people in their school intervened when 
hearing negative remarks about gender expression 
(see Figure 4.4):

• Rates of staff intervention were similar from 
2003 to 2011. There was a small decrease 
in staff intervention from 2011 to 2013, and 
intervention has largely remained at a similar 
rate in subsequent years. The rates of staff 
intervention beginning in 2013 were lower 
than prior years. In 2021, the rate of staff 
intervention was not different from the 2013 
survey onward.366 

• Rates of intervention by other students were 
in an upward trend after 2013, with a slight 
decline in 2019, but an increase in 2021 
when it was higher than most prior years.367

Taking into account all the results related to 
anti-LGBTQ+ remarks in schools, there were few 
positive changes in 2021. In 2021, most types of 
anti-LGBTQ+ remarks made by students were at 
similar rates as we saw in 2019. The one notable 
exception was with negative remarks about gender 
expression, which had increased in 2021 from 
2019, but were still lower in frequency than all prior 
years. Students in 2021, however, increased in their 
levels of intervention when hearing anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks. But regarding school staff, LGBTQ+ 
students in 2021 reported an increase in hearing

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYanti-LGBTQ+ remarks from them and less frequent 
intervention with regard to homophobic remarks and 
no change in intervention with regard to negative 
gender remarks. It is possible that this general 
lack of positive change was related to changes in 
school instruction in the 2020–2021 academic 
year as a result of COVID. However, we account for 
differences across years in personal demographics 
and school characteristics in our analyses, which 
would theoretically address some of this. This 
lack of positive change may be related to changes 
in public opinion and in public discourse during 
the 2020–2021 academic year, especially when 
considering the increase in the reported negative 
actions or inaction by the adults in school.

Experiences of Harassment and Assault  
Over Time

To gain further understanding of changes in 
school climate for LGBTQ+ students in secondary 
schools, we examined the incidence of reported 
anti-LGBTQ+ harassment and assault over time. 
Since 2001, we have assessed the frequency 
of experiencing verbal and physical harassment 
and physical assault based on sexual orientation, 
gender expression and gender in school.

With regard to victimization related to sexual 
orientation:368 

• Verbal harassment changed little between 

2001 and 2007, declined significantly from 

2007 to 2015, but did not change from 2015 
to 2019. In 2021, the frequency did not differ 
from 2019 (see Figure 4.5).

• Physical harassment changed little between 

2001 to 2005, and increased in 2007. Since 
2007, the frequency has generally been in 
decline. However, in 2021, the frequency did 
not differ from 2019, but both years were 
lower than all years prior to 2017 (see also 
Figure 4.5). 

• Physical assault changed little between 2001 
and 2007, but generally was in decline from 
2011 onward. In 2021, the frequency was 
lower than all prior years (see also Figure 4.5). 

With regard to victimization related to gender 
expression:369

• Verbal harassment did not change between 
2001 and 2007, and generally decreased 
from 2009 to 2019. In 2021,however, the 
frequency did not differ from 2019, but both 
years were lower than most prior years (see 
Figure 4.6).

• Physical harassment declined starting in 2007 
after few changes among prior years, but did 
not change from 2017 to 2021. However, rates 
of physical harassment in the years 2017 to 
2021 were lower than years 2015 and earlier 
(see also Figure 4.6).

2007 after few changes among prior years, and

years (see also Figure 4.6).

With regard to victimization related to gender:370

• Verbal harassment changed little between 

2001 and 2011, but was lower in later years 
of the survey than the years prior to 2011. In 
2021, the frequency was lower than 2017 and 
all years 2011 and earlier (see Figure 4.7).

• Physical harassment changed little between 

2001 and 2007, and generally declined from 
2009 onward. In 2021, the frequency did not 
differ from 2019 but was lower than years 
2013 and earlier (see also Figure 4.7).

• Physical assault did not change between 2001 
and 2009, except for a significant increase 
in 2007. From 2011, the frequency generally 
declined, and in 2021 was lower than all years 
but 2019.

Reporting of School-Based Harassment and 
Assault Over Time

In 2003, we began asking students about the 
frequency of students reporting experiences of 
victimization to school staff. Across years, as 
shown in Figure 4.8, we saw that the highest level 
of reporting was in 2003 and the lowest levels in 
2007 and 2009, Since that time, we saw a small 
but significant incline in the frequency of reporting 
up to 2017. The frequency of reporting did not 
differ from 2017 to 2021.371

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYIn 2005, we began asking students how effective 
their teachers or other school staff were in 
addressing incidents of harassment and assault 
when students reported them. Across all years, a 
minority of students reported that any intervention 
on the part of school staff was effective— 
generally between 30% and 40% reported that 
staff intervention was somewhat or very effective 
across years (see Figure 4.8). The highest levels  
of effectiveness were reported in 2005. In 2021,  
the effectiveness of reporting was similar to  
that from the most recent years of the survey 
(2013 to 2019).372 

Considering all changes over time with regard 
to victimization, we have seen significant 
improvements in more recent years compared to 
the first years of our biennial survey, but few recent 
changes. In 2021, the rates of verbal and physical 
harassment based on sexual orientation, gender 
expression, and gender were generally similar to 
2019 but lower than in 2017. In contrast, for all 
three types of physical assault, the rates in 2021 
were significantly lower than nearly all prior years. 
Even though we accounted for differences in 
types of learning environments in the 2020–2021 
academic year, it may still be that the decrease in 
physical assault was related to fewer opportunities 
for in-person, peer-to-peer contact, even in schools 
where students were in school in-person. However, 
we did not see that same decline in physical 
harassment. 

With regard to reporting harassment and assault, 
the rate has not changed in recent years. In 2021, 
as discussed in the “Reporting of School-Based 
Harassment and Assault” in “Part One” of this 
report, LGBTQ+ students who were in online 

learning environments during any time in the 
2020–2021 academic year may not have known 
procedures for reporting online victimization. 
Given that the preponderance of LGBTQ+ students 
had had some online learning, whether it was 
full-time or in hybrid settings, it is possible that 
that may account for the lack of change seen in 
2021, even though we attempt to account for 
learning environment in our analyses. With regard 
to the perceived effectiveness of staff response to 
reported victimization, it is hopeful that the level  
of effectiveness was higher in the later years of  
the survey, despite there being no recent change 
in the frequency of reporting incidents. In sum, 
although we do not see an overall trend that 
schools are becoming appreciably safer for 
LGBTQ+ students, we do not see that they have 
become significantly worse.

Experiences of Discrimination Over Time

In addition to hearing anti-LGBTQ+ remarks 
in the hallways and directly experiencing 
victimization from other students, LGBTQ+-
related discriminatory policies and practices 
also contribute to a hostile school experience for 
LGBTQ+ students. As mentioned previously in the 
section Experiences of Discrimination at School, 
we began asking students about a number of 
specific LGBTQ+-related discriminatory policies 
and practices at their school in 2013, and in this 
section, we examine how these experiences may 
have changed between 2013 and 2021.373

Figure 4.9 shows the incidence of having had any 
experience with anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination at 
school over the five time points, along with the 
incidences for the specific types of discriminatory

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYpolicies or practices asked across the five 
surveys. Overall, over half of LGBTQ+ students 
experienced some type of LGBTQ+-related 
discrimination at school at all five time points. 
In 2019, the percentage of LGBTQ+ students 
who had experienced any form of anti-LGBTQ+ 
discrimination had declined from the previous 
years; however, the percentage increased in  
2021 and it was not different from the years  
2013 to 2017.374 

With regard to the specific forms of discrimination, 
the percentages for most forms were highest in 
2013, except for bathroom and locker room use 
and clothing-related discrimination.375 In 2019, 
we saw a decline in most forms of discrimination 
from prior years. In 2021, however, many of these 
forms of discrimination increased, specifically, 
restrictions on the use of names and pronouns, 
clothing based on gender, clothing supporting 
LGBTQ+ issue, and school dances, as well 
as generally being disciplined for identifying 
as LGBTQ+. It is important to note that two 
forms of discrimination that were specific to 
gender — prevented from using one’s preferred 
name or pronouns and being prohibited from 
wearing clothes of another gender — increased 
from 2019 to 2021; however, the third gender-
specific form of discrimination — being prohibited 
from bathroom or locker room use based on 
gender — was not different in 2021 than 2019. 
Even though we accounted for differences in 
types of learning environments in the 2020–2021 
academic year, it may be that focus on name/
pronoun use and clothing choices (and perhaps, 
the use of make-up), by educators was heightened 
in online learning platforms, whereas the use of 
school facilities was more limited due to COVID-
related prevention (e.g., measures to limit person-
to-person contact during in-person instruction).

LGBTQ+-Related Resources Over Time

In 2001, we began asking LGBTQ+ students in 
the NSCS about the availability of LGBTQ+-related 
resources in school, such as GSAs (Gay-Straight 
Alliances or Gender and Sexuality Alliances) and 
curricular resources. In this section, we examine 
the levels of availability of these supportive school 
resources over time.

a GSA at school; however, in 2021, the percentage 
of LGBTQ+ students who had a GSA available 
at their school dropped significantly (see Figure 
4.10).376 The percentage of students reporting 
that they had a GSA at school has increased from 
under 40% in 2007 to over 60% in 2019 but fell 
to under 40% again in 2021. It is possible that 
extracurricular activities in general were curtailed 
in the 2020–2021 academic years because of 
COVID restrictions, which could explain this  
sharp decline.

Inclusive Curricular Resources. Overall, there have 
been few positive changes in LGBTQ+ curricular 
resources over time (see Figure 4.11):

• Internet access to LGBTQ+ content on school 
computers was highest in 2019 but decreased 
in 2021. Access was higher in 2021, however, 
than years 2013 and prior.377 

• Access to LGBTQ+ books and resources in 

school libraries was also highest in 2019 and 
decreased in 2021. Overall, there have been 
few changes across the years in the availability 
of school library resources.378 

• The availability of LGBTQ+ information in 

textbooks and class resources has historically 
been one of the least commonly reported 
curricular supports for LGBTQ+ students,  
and the percentage of LGBTQ+ students in 
2021 who reported LGBTQ+ inclusion in 
textbooks and class resources had not  
changed from 2019;379

• Being taught positive LGBTQ+ material in 

class has also been one of the least common 
curricular supports and has changed little 
in recent years. However, the percentage of 
LGBTQ+ students who reported being taught 
positive LGBTQ+ information in classes was 
lower in 2021 than in the more recent years of 
the survey - 2015, 2017, and 2019.380

It is interesting to note that there has not been 
much change over the years with regard to LGBTQ+ 
students being taught negative LGBTQ+-related 
content in class. Since we first asked this question 
in 2013, the percentage increased slightly in 
2015, and has not changed since that time.381

Supportive Student Clubs. In our 2019 survey, we 
saw a steady, significant increase from previous 
years in the percentage of LGBTQ+ students having 

Supportive School Personnel. In 2003, we began 
asking LGBTQ+ students about the number

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYof school personnel who were supportive of 
LGBTQ+ students.382 Across the years, we had 
seen a general, positive increasing trend in the 
number of supportive educators at school (see 
Figure 4.12).383 In 2021, however, the number 
of supportive school personnel was lower than 
in recent years, specifically 2013 to 2019. 
Nevertheless, the number of supportive school 
personnel in 2021 was higher than early years of 
the survey, specifically 2009 and earlier. As shown 
in Figure 4.12, the percentage reporting 6 or more 
supportive educators ranged from under 50% in 
the earlier years of the survey, to nearly 70% in 
2019 but to less than 60% in 2021. However, as 
also shown in Figure 4.12, since 2011, more than 
95% of LGBTQ+ students reported having at least 
one supportive school personnel at school.

Bullying, Harassment, and Assault Policies. In 
all years, as shown in Figure 4.13, the majority 
of LGBTQ+ students reported that their schools 
had some type of anti-bullying/harassment policy; 
however, the minority of students reported that the 
policy enumerated sexual orientation and/or gender 
identity/expression. Overall, there was a sharp 
increase in the number of students reporting any 
type of policy after 2009, and the rate has remained 
more or less consistent since 2011. From 2011 to 
2015, there had generally been small increases with 
regard to any type of anti-bullying/harassment policy, 
followed by a small decline from 2015 to 2017. In 
2021, the rate had not changed from 2019 but was 
somewhat lower than 2017.384

With regard to enumerated policies, there was 
little change from 2005 to 2013. However, from 
2015 to 2019, we saw a pattern of small increases 
in the percentages of LGBTQ+ students who 
reported having comprehensive policies (i.e., fully 
enumerated),385 and small decreases in those who 
reported partially enumerated policies.386 However, 
in 2021, the percentage of LGBTQ+ student 
reporting comprehensive policies was lower than 
in 2019 and the percentage reporting partially 
enumerated policies had not changed. 

In 2021, LGBTQ+ students were less likely to 
report having nearly all LGBTQ+ resources than in 
2019. Some of these differences may be related 
to limitations to in-person contact because of 
COVID. For example, it may be that school staff 
were more limited in having one-on-one contact 
with students in general, whether it be because of 
limitations with the capacity for online meetings 
or general restrictions on in-person meetings 
because of COVID, which may have resulted in 
LGBTQ+ students reporting a lower number of 
supportive educators in 2021. Regarding GSAs, 
schools that were online during the 2020–2021 
academic year may not have transitioned 
extracurricular clubs to online spaces, and schools 
that had in-person instruction may not have had 
extracurricular activities because of COVID-related 
prevention practices. Access to school libraries 
may also have been limited for those in in-person 
instruction because of COVID safety protocols, 
and not have been physical accessible for those

in online instruction. Similarly, access to school 
computers may have been restricted for those 
in in-person learning environments for similar 
reasons, if the computers were in common areas 
of the school building, such as the library or a 
computer room. Restrictions in person-to-person 
contact does not, however, explain why inclusion 
of LGBTQ+ content in the curriculum was lower in 
2021 than 2019. It may be that this decrease in 
positive LGBTQ+ curricular inclusion reflects the 
shift in public discourse about diversity in school 
curriculum, specifically with regard to teaching the 
histories, experiences, or perspectives of LGBTQ+ 
people and people of color. In spring 2021, many 
state legislatures were considering curriculum 
censorship bills ostensibly opposing the teaching 
of critical race theory.387 Also in 2021, three states 
passed bills that allow parents to opt their students 
out of any lessons or coursework that mentions 
sexual orientation or gender identity.388 Efforts to 
erase or prohibit content inclusive of communities 
that experience marginalization may have had a 
chilling effect on educators who feared heightened 
scrutiny.389 This shift in public discourse about 
curriculum may also, in part, explain the decrease 
in enumerated school anti-bullying and harassment 

policies — education leaders may have confounded 
protections based on sexual orientation, gender 
identity, and gender expression as inclusion of 
sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender 
expression content.  

Student Acceptance of LGBTQ+ People  
Over Time

Previously in this part of the report, we noted that 
the frequency of student intervention with regard to 
homophobic remarks and negative remarks about 
gender expression increased in 2021. However, 
we also found the availability of most LGBTQ+ 
supports in schools had decreased in 2021, which 
are related to a more accepting student body 
(see the Utility of School-Based Resources and 
Supports section of this report). These findings 
raise the question as to whether student attitudes 
about LGBTQ+ people have changed, and if so, in 
what ways. We examined whether student attitudes 
toward LGBTQ+ people have changed over time, 
and found that although student acceptance 
steadily increased from 2011 to 2015, it had 
largely level off until 2019, and was significantly

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYConclusions

Taking into account all the results related to 
negative indicators of school climate, e.g., anti-
LGBTQ+ remarks and victimization, there were 
few positive changes in 2021. Most types of 
anti-LGBTQ+ remarks made by students in 2021 
were at rates similar to those seen in 2019. 
Thus, schools have not necessarily become safer 
for LGBTQ+ students, but they have not become 
significantly worse with regard to their peer 
interactions. There were also some concerning 
changes with regard to school staff. School staff 
were reported to have more frequently made anti-
LGBTQ+ remarks themselves, and fewer were seen 
as supportive of LGBTQ+ students in their schools. 
In addition, school staff were reported to be less 
likely to intervene when anti-LGBTQ+ remarks were 
made, although students in 2021 did not differ 
from those in 2019 with regard to how often they 
reported victimization to staff and in how effective 
staff actions were when such incidents were 
reported. As discussed previously, some of these 
differences may be due to changes in how schools 
were operating in the 2020–2021 academic 
year, but it may also signal changes in public 
opinion and in public discourse, especially when 
considering the increase in the reported negative 
actions or inaction by the adults in school.

It is also a concern that when considering changes 
in anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination in school, we saw 
higher levels of reported discrimination in LGBTQ+ 
self-expression in general — preventing students 
from wearing clothes related to LGBTQ+ issues 
or one’s gender, using one’s name/pronoun, and 
general discipline for identifying as LGBTQ+. More 
specifically, a concerning pattern emerged that 
we saw in 2017 with regard to gender-specific 
problems in schools — negative remarks about 
gender expression increased both from students 
and school staff and two gender-specific forms 
of discrimination increased from 2019 to 2021. 
It may be that public discourse on transgender 

students, such as policy battles about bathroom 
access and access to sports teams and athletic 
facilities, and about LGBTQ+ curricular inclusion 
have brought LGBTQ+ student issues, and 
transgender student issues in particular, to the 
forefront in U.S. schools.

In 2021, LGBTQ+ students were less likely to 
report having nearly all LGBTQ+ resources than 
those in 2019. Some of these differences may be 
related to limitations to in-person contact because 
of COVID, and as schools return to the usual in-
person learning, gaps in available supports may 
be reduced. However, these changes in supportive 
school personnel and curricular inclusion may also 
be related to greater negative public discourse 
on LGBTQ+ issues in education. Given that there 
continue to be legislative battles about school 
curriculum and about LGBTQ+ expression in 
schools since we conducted our 2021 survey, it 
is a serious concern that LGBTQ+ supports could 
continue to decline.

In our 2019 report, we developed a hypothesis 
that the effects of positive changes in LGBTQ+ 
school supports seen in one year are then reflected 
in subsequent years as decreases in the negative 
indicators of school climate. We expressed some 
hope that the increases in supports in 2019 would 
be reflected in decreases in anti-LGBTQ+ incidents 
in school in 2021. Unfortunately, perhaps because 
of changes in school environments as a result 
of COVID, we largely did not see the expected 
decreases in anti-LGBTQ+ incidents, although 
we did not see much indication of such incidents 
increasing either. It gives us pause that we saw 
such a significant decline in LGBTQ+ supports in 
2021, with respect to how that may affect school 
climate for LGBTQ+ students in later school years. 
Overall, our findings over time clearly show that 
more work is needed to make schools safer and 
more affirming for LGBTQ+ students, particularly 
in establishing positive supports in school.

DISCUSSION

Limitations

Although there are no national population 
parameters regarding LGBTQ+ youth, we believe 
that the methods used for our survey resulted in 
a nationally representative sample of LGBTQ+ 
students who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender, or queer (or another non-heterosexual 
sexual orientation and/or non-cisgender gender 
identity) and who were able to find out about the 
survey in some way, either through a connection 
to LGBTQ+ or youth-serving organizations that 
publicized the survey, or through social media. As 
discussed in the Methods and Sample section, we 
conducted targeted advertising on the social media 
sites Facebook and Instagram in order to broaden 
our reach and obtain a more representative 
sample. Advertising on these sites allowed 
LGBTQ+ students who did not necessarily have any 
formal connection to the LGBTQ+ community to 
participate in the survey. However, the social media 
advertisements for the survey were shown only 
to youth who would have had visited pages that 
include LGBTQ+ content, or who were connected 
to GLSEN’s social media in some way.391 LGBTQ+ 
youth who were not comfortable viewing pages with 
LGBTQ+ content or youth who were not connected 
to GLSEN pages in some way through their social 
network would not have received the advertisement 
about the survey. Thus, LGBTQ+ youth who are 
perhaps the most isolated — those without a formal 
connection to the LGBTQ+ community or without 
access to online resources and supports, and those 
who are not comfortable viewing LGBTQ+ content 
on social media — may be underrepresented in the 
survey sample.

The sample also did not include students who have 
a sexual attraction to the same gender or multiple 
genders, but who do not identify themselves as 
LGBQ.392 These youth may be more isolated, 
unaware of supports available to them, or, even 
if aware, uncomfortable using such supports. 
Similarly, youth whose gender identity is not the 
same as their sex assigned at birth, but who do 
not identify as transgender, may also be more 
isolated and without the same access to resources 
as the youth in our survey. The survey was primarily 
advertised as being for LGBTQ+ students, and 
students who did not identify as LGBTQ+ but 
nevertheless self-identified in ways other than 
heterosexual and cisgender may have been less 
likely to participate in the survey, even though they 
were included in the survey sample. For example, 

among asexual students in particular, some  
may not identify as LGBTQ+ and the sample 
of asexual students in our survey would not 
necessarily reflect the experiences of those 
students.

Another possible limitation to the survey is related 
to the sample’s racial/ethnic composition — the 
percentage of LGBQ African American/Black 
students and LGBQ Hispanic/Latinx students were 
lower, and LGBQ White students was higher than 
compared to LGBQ secondary school students 
from other population-based data.393 In part, this 
discrepancy may be related to different methods 
for measuring race/ethnicity. In our survey, 
students were asked one question about their race/
ethnicity, and could choose multiple options.394 In 
contrast, national youth surveys often include two 
questions  — one about whether the respondent 
identifies as Hispanic/Latinx, and the other about 
their race.395 This difference in methodology may 
also impact how students choose to identify in 
the survey, and thus may account for some of the 
discrepancy in racial/ethnic representation between 
our LGBQ sample and LGBQ secondary students 
from other population-based data. Nevertheless, 
it is possible that LGBQ African American/Black 
students and LGBQ Hispanic/Latinx students  
were underrepresented, and LGBQ White  
students were overrepresented in our sample. 
Additionally, because there are no national 
statistics on the demographic breakdown of 
transgender-identified youth, we cannot know 
how our transgender sample compares to other 
population-based studies.

Our sample, like other national samples of LGBTQ+ 
youth, included a small percentage of cisgender 
males who identified as gay, bisexual, or queer. It 
may be that these youth are less likely to be out in 
middle school or high school, and would be less 
likely to learn about the survey or feel comfortable 
taking a survey specifically for LGBTQ+ students. 
Additionally, our sample had a small percentage of 
transgender female students. In that our sample 
only includes students who had been in school 
during the 2020–2021 school year, it is possible 
that transgender girls leave school at higher rates 
than do transgender boys, thereby leading to fewer 
transgender girls eligible to take our survey. It 
is also possible that transgender boys come out 
earlier than do transgender girls, which would lead 
to lower numbers of transgender female secondary 
school students.

128

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYGiven that our survey is available only in English 
and Spanish, LGBTQ+ students who are not 
proficient in either of those languages might be 
limited in their ability to participate. Thus, these 
students may also be underrepresented in our 
survey sample.

It is also important to note that our survey only 
reflects the experiences of LGBTQ+ students who 
were in school during the 2020–2021 school year. 
Although our sample does allow for students who 
had left school at some point during the 2020–
2021 school year to participate, it still does not 
reflect the experiences of LGBTQ+ youth who may 
have already dropped out in prior school years. The 
experiences of these youth may likely differ from 
those students who remained in school, particularly 
with regard to hostile school climate, access to 
supportive resources, severity of school discipline, 
and educational aspirations.

Lastly, the data from our survey are cross-sectional 
(i.e., the data were collected at one point in time), 
which means that we cannot determine causality. 
For example, although we can say that there was 
a relationship between the number of supportive 
staff and students’ academic achievement, we 
cannot say that one predicts the other.

While considering these limitations, our attempts 
at diverse recruitment of a hard-to-reach 
population have yielded a sample of LGBTQ+ 
students that we believe most likely closely reflects 
the population of LGBTQ+ middle and high school 
students in the U.S.

Conclusion and Recommendations

The 2021 National School Climate Survey continues 
to provide evidence that schools are often unsafe 
learning environments for LGBTQ+ students. 
Hearing biased or derogatory language at school, 
especially sexist remarks, homophobic remarks, 
and negative remarks about gender expression, was 
a common occurrence. Almost 8 in 10 students 
in our survey reported feeling unsafe at school 
because of at least one personal characteristic, 
with sexual orientation and gender expression 
being the most commonly reported characteristics. 
Students also frequently reported avoiding spaces 
in their schools that they perceived as being unsafe, 
especially bathrooms, locker rooms, and physical 
education (P.E.) or gym classes. The vast majority 
of LGBTQ+ youth who attended school in-person 

during the academic year reported being verbally 
harassed because of their sexual orientation, gender 
expression, or gender (SOGIE). In addition, many 
of these students reported experiencing incidents 
of physical harassment and assault related to their 
LGBTQ+ identities, as well as other incidents 
of victimization such as sexual harassment, 
cyberbullying, and deliberate property damage at 
school. In addition, many LGBTQ+ students who 
attended school experienced online harassment 
during the school day related to their LGBTQ+ 
identities, with over a third having been harassed 
online regarding their sexual orientation. 

In addition to anti-LGBTQ+ behavior by peers, 
be it biased language in the hallways or direct 
personal victimization, the majority of LGBTQ+ 
students also faced anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory 
school policies and practices. Schools prohibited 
LGBTQ+ students from expressing themselves 
through their clothing or their relationships, limited 
LGBTQ+ inclusion in curricular and extracurricular 
activities, and enforced other policies that 
negatively affected transgender and nonbinary 
students in particular, such as preventing use of 
their chosen name or pronoun.

Overall, the vast majority of LGBTQ+ students 
experienced identity-based harassment while 
attending school in-person only, online only, and in 
hybrid online and in-person settings. However, our 
results suggest that the frequency of victimization 
was related to the type of learning environments 
the students were in. Students who attended 
school in-person for the entire year experienced 
more in-person victimization than hybrid students 
who were only in person for a portion of the year. 
Similarly, online only students experienced more 
cyber harassment than hybrid students. Thus, the 
more time a student spent in an online versus in-
person learning environment was related to  
the degree of victimization they experienced online 
and in-person, respectively. LGBTQ+ students 
who were in hybrid settings experienced a lower 
frequency of both forms of victimization, but 
they were exposed to both online and in-person 
victimization, in contrast to their peers in online 
only or in-person only environments who only 
experienced one form. LGBTQ+ students who were 
in school in-person entirely were also far more 
likely to experience any form of LGBTQ+-related 
discrimination than those in the other types of 
learning environments.

129

LGBTQ+ students are a diverse population, and 
the results from our 2021 survey reveal important 
differences among these students. Transgender 
and nonbinary students in particular were more 
likely to have felt unsafe and face anti-LGBTQ+ 
victimization at school than their cisgender LGBQ 
peers. Similarly, pansexual students were more 
likely to feel unsafe and experienced greater levels 
of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization than their LGBTQ+ 
peers with other sexual orientations. Furthermore, 
we found that LGBTQ+ students of color (including 
Black, AAPI, Latinx, Native and Indigenous, 
MENA, and multiracial LGBTQ+ students) 
commonly experienced both racist and anti-
LGBTQ+ victimization at school, and were more 
likely to experience multiple forms of victimization 
than White LGBTQ+ students.

Results from our survey also demonstrate 
the serious consequences that anti-LGBTQ+ 
victimization and discrimination can have on 
LGBTQ+ students’ academic success and their 
general well-being. LGBTQ+ students who 
experienced frequent harassment and assault 
based on their sexual orientation or gender 
expression reported missing more days of school, 
having lower GPAs, lower educational aspirations, 
and higher rates of school discipline than students 
who were harassed less often. In addition, students 
who experienced higher levels of victimization felt 
less connected to their school community and 
had poorer psychological well-being, including a 
higher likelihood of suicidal ideation. LGBTQ+ 
students who reported experiencing anti-LGBTQ+ 
discrimination at school also had worse educational 
outcomes, including missing more days of school, 
lower GPAs, and lower educational aspirations, 
and were more likely to be disciplined at school, 
than students who did not experience anti-LGBTQ+ 
discrimination. Furthermore, students who 
experienced anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination also felt 
less connected to their school community and had 
poorer psychological well-being.

School personnel are charged with providing a safe 
learning environment for all students. Teachers 
and other school authorities, however, most often 
did not intervene when anti-LGBTQ+ remarks were 
made in their presence, leaving the use of anti-
LGBTQ+ language largely unchallenged in school. 
Furthermore, the majority of LGBTQ+ students 
did not report harassment or assault to school 
personnel, most often because they believed that 
there would be no effective action. And even when 

students did report incidents of victimization, the 
most common staff responses were to do nothing 
or merely to tell the student to ignore it. LGBTQ+ 
students’ reporting of harassment and assault 
did differ by learning environment (online only, 
hybrid, and in-person only) – students in in-person 
learning environments reported harassment to 
school staff at higher rates than did students in 
online only or hybrid settings. It is possible that 
students who only attended school in-person had 
more frequent and regular contact with school 
staff, and had greater access to teachers and other 
school staff. Additionally, students who were in 
in-person only learning environments would likely 
have been already familiar with procedures for 
reporting harassment from the previous academic 
year, whereas students in online only or hybrid 
learning environments likely were in schools that 
had to make adjustments to reporting procedures 
to adapt to the online learning environment, and 
students may have been unsure of or unfamiliar 
with these procedures.

In spite of the lack of action by school personnel 
in general with regard to interventions when 
anti-LGBTQ+ event occurred in school, the vast 
majority of the LGBTQ+ students in our survey 
did have at least one adult at school who was 
supportive of LGBTQ+ students. Further, our 
findings demonstrate the important role that 
supportive school staff can and do play in creating 
safer and more affirming learning environments for 
LGBTQ+ students. Supportive educators positively 
influenced students’ academic performance, 
educational aspirations, feelings of safety, school 
absenteeism (missing fewer days of school), 
psychological well-being, and connection to 
their school community. Furthermore, when staff 
responded effectively to incidents of victimization, 
LGBTQ+ students reported less anti-LGBTQ+ 
victimization than LGBTQ+ students in schools 
where staff responded ineffectively. 

In addition to their role in providing direct support 
and in intervening when anti-LGBTQ+ events 
occur at school, educators also serve a crucial role 
in teaching a curriculum that includes positive 
representations of LGBTQ+ people, history, and 
events. By teaching about LGBTQ+ topics in a 
positive manner, educators may enhance the 
connections of their LGBTQ+ students to the 
school environment and to learning, in general. 
Students in schools where their classroom included 
positive representations of LGBTQ+ history, people, 

130

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYor events had better educational outcomes, were 
more comfortable engaging in conversations about 
LGBTQ+ issues with their teachers, and had a 
greater connection to their school community. 
Furthermore, by teaching positive LGBTQ+-related 
content in class, educators may also increase 
the knowledge, awareness, and acceptance of 
LGBTQ+ people for all students in school. LGBTQ+ 
students who reported positive curricular inclusion 
were less likely to feel unsafe and miss school for 
safety reasons, and reported less hostile behavior 
from peers (i.e., less anti-LGBTQ+ language and 
victimization). Students with positive curricular 
inclusion also reported that their peers were more 
likely to intervene regarding anti-LGBTQ+ biased 
remarks, and were more accepting of LGBTQ+ 
people in general.

In addition to having supportive educators at 
school, the results from our survey also call 
attention to the important role that institutional 
supports and resources have in making schools 
safer and promoting better educational outcomes 
and healthy youth development for these students. 
Our findings indicate that GSAs (Gay-Straight 
Alliances/Gender and Sexuality Alliances) and 
similar clubs also play a key role in improving 
school climate for LGBTQ+ students. Students 
who attended schools with a GSA or similar club 
were less likely to feel unsafe at school and miss 
school for safety reasons, heard fewer anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks at school, reported more frequent staff and 
peer intervention regarding anti-LGBTQ+ remarks, 
and experienced less anti-LGBTQ+ victimization 
both online and in-person. Thus, GSAs may 
demonstrate to the whole school community that 
anti-LGBTQ+ behaviors should not be tolerated, 
and that they must be addressed when they do 
occur. Students who had a GSA at school also 
reported that their peers were more accepting of 
LGBTQ+ people in general, indicating that GSAs 
may provide awareness to the student community 
of LGBTQ+ student issues. Furthermore, having a 
GSA at school was also associated with a greater 
sense of belonging to the school community and 
greater psychological well-being among LGBTQ+ 
students, perhaps as a result of the overall positive 
impact of GSAs on the school environment.

With regard to school policies, our findings 
indicate important benefits associated with 
both comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment 
policies, as well as policies affirming the rights 
of transgender and nonbinary students. LGBTQ+ 

students with comprehensive anti-bullying/
harassment policies that included protections for 
sexual orientation and gender identity/expression 
reported hearing less anti-LGBTQ+ language and 
greater staff intervention when anti-LGBTQ+ biased 
remarks were made, as well as reported lower levels 
of anti-LGBTQ+ victimization and more effective 
staff response when incidents were reported. 
Furthermore, having a policy that enumerated 
either sexual orientation or gender expression 
but not both was often no more effective than a 
policy with no enumeration or no policy at all. 
Comprehensive anti-bullying/harassment policies 
may provide important instruction for students on 
reporting victimization, as well as guidance for 
educators that these anti-LGBTQ+ behaviors must 
be addressed and on the appropriate strategies 
for intervention. Similarly, policies affirming 
transgender and nonbinary students’ rights 
appear to improve school climate, particularly for 
transgender and nonbinary students. Transgender 
and nonbinary students with such policies or 
guidelines were less likely to miss school because 
of feeling unsafe, felt a greater sense of belonging 
to their school community, and were less likely to 
experience gender-related discrimination.

Unfortunately, each of the LGBTQ+-related 
resources and supports that we examined were 
not available to all LGBTQ+ students. GSAs were 
somewhat more common than other resources, 
although more than half did not have an active 
GSA at their school during the 2020–2021 
academic year. Most students could not identify 
a large number of school staff (11 or more) who 
were supportive of LGBTQ+ students, and a small 
number were unable to identify any supportive 
staff. Furthermore, many LGBTQ+ students lacked 
access to positive LGBTQ+ information from 
school libraries and school computers, and few 
LGBTQ+ students reported being taught LGBTQ+ 
information in class or having this material in 
their textbooks and other class readings. With 
regard to supportive school policies, although a 
majority of students said that their school had 
some type of harassment/assault policy, few said 
that it was a comprehensive policy that explicitly 
stated protections based on sexual orientation 
and gender identity/expression, and less than a 
tenth reported that they had official policies or 
guidelines to support transgender and nonbinary 
students at their schools. Although all LGBTQ+ 
students commonly lacked access to supportive 
resources at school, those in middle schools, 

131

religiously-affiliated private schools, schools in 
rural areas, and schools in the South and Midwest, 
were all less likely than others to report having 
these resources. These findings underscore the 
importance of advocating for GSAs, supportive 
staff, inclusive curricular resources, and supportive 
school policies in all schools to ensure positive 
learning environments for LGBTQ+ students 
everywhere—environments in which students can 
be successful in learning, graduate, and continue 
on to further their education. Furthermore, given 
that LGBTQ+ students in in-person learning 
environments during the 2020–2021 academic 
year were often less likely to have supportive 
resources than those in online only learning or 
hybrid environments, schools may need to redouble 
their efforts to provide positive supports for 
LGBTQ+ students as they return to more regular 
in-person instructional practices.

The findings in this report show few gains toward 
safe and inclusive schools for LGBTQ+ secondary 
school students since our last report. Taking 
into account all the results related to negative 
indicators of school climate, such as anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks and victimization, there was little change 
in students’ experiences of hostile school climate 
from our 2019 findings. Thus, schools have not 
necessarily become safer for LGBTQ+ students, but 
they have not become significantly worse with regard 
to their peer interactions. However, there were some 
concerning changes with regard to school staff. Our 
findings show staff more frequently making anti-
LGBTQ+ remarks themselves, and fewer staff being 
seen as supportive of LGBTQ+ students in their 
schools. In addition, school staff were reported to be 
less likely to intervene when anti-LGBTQ+ remarks 
were made. With regard to positive school supports, 
LGBTQ+ students were less likely to report having 
nearly all LGBTQ+ resources in 2021 compared to 
2019. Some of these differences may be related 
to limitations to in-person contact because of 
COVID, and as schools return to the usual in-person 
learning, gaps in available supports may be reduced. 
However, these changes in supportive school 
personnel and curricular inclusion may not be wholly 
explained by changes in schools because of COVID 
and may also be related to greater negative public 
discourse on LGBTQ+ issues in education. Given 
that there continue to be legislative battles about 
school curriculum and about LGBTQ+ expression 
in schools since we conducted our 2021 survey, it 
is a serious concern that LGBTQ+ supports could 
continue to decline. 

In Part 4, we discuss a hypothesis developed from 
our 2019 findings that the effects of positive 
changes in LGBTQ+ school supports seen in one 
year are then reflected in subsequent years as 
decreases in the negative indicators of school 
climate, and we expressed some hope that the 
increases in supports in 2019 would be reflected 
in decreases in anti-LGBTQ+ incidents in school in 
2021. Unfortunately, perhaps because of changes 
in school environments as a result of COVID, we 
did not see the expected decreases in anti-LGBTQ+ 
incidents, although we did not see much indication 
of such incidents increasing either. It is of grave 
concern that we saw such a significant decline in 
LGBTQ+ supports in 2021 with respect to how that 
may affect school climate for LGBTQ+ students in 
later school years. Overall, our findings over time 
clearly show that more work is needed to make 
schools safer and more affirming for LGBTQ+ 
students, particularly in establishing positive 
supports in school.

To date, there is no federal legislation that 
has explicitly established protections from 
discrimination in schools based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. Although 
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 
1972 (Title IX) prohibits discrimination based 
on sex in federally-funded schools, federal 
administrative policy has been inconsistent in 
communicating that discrimination based on 
sex includes discrimination based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity.396 The U.S. 
Department of Education has proposed a revised 
rule that expressly states that Title IX prohibits 
discrimination based on sexual orientation and 
gender identity, including harassment that creates 
a hostile environment. Nevertheless, despite this 
progress on the federal level, education is primarily 
the responsibility of state and local authorities.397 
For example, states set standards regarding 
what must be taught, and school districts create 
curriculum based on these standards. And in 
2021, we began to see heightened state legislative 
activity with regard to disallowing diversity in 
school curriculum, specifically with regard to 
teaching the histories, experiences, or perspectives 
of LGBTQ+ people and people of color. Thus, 
focused efforts to improve state and local policies 
are needed to provide positive school environments 
for LGBTQ+ youth.

There are steps that concerned stakeholders 
can take on behalf of LGBTQ+ students. Results 

132

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEYfrom the 2021 National School Climate Survey 
demonstrate the ways in which the presence of 
supportive student clubs, supportive educators, 
inclusive and supportive policies, and other school-
based resources and supports can positively affect 
LGBTQ+ students’ school experiences. Therefore, 
we recommend the following measures:

• Support student clubs, such as Gay-Straight 
Alliances or Gender and Sexuality Alliances 
(GSAs), that provide support for LGBTQ+ 
students and address LGBTQ+ issues in 
education;

• Provide training for school staff to improve 

rates of intervention and increase the number 
of supportive teachers and other staff available 
to students;

• Increase student access to appropriate and 
accurate information regarding LGBTQ+ 
people, history, and events through inclusive 
curricula and library and Internet resources; 

• Ensure that school policies and practices, 
such as those related to dress codes and 
extracurricular activities including sports, do 
not discriminate against LGBTQ+ students;

• Enact and implement policies and practices 

to ensure transgender and nonbinary students 
have equal access to education, such as having 
access to gendered facilities that correspond to 
their gender; and

• Adopt and implement comprehensive school 
and district anti-bullying/harassment policies 
that specifically enumerate sexual orientation, 
gender identity, and gender expression as 
protected categories alongside others such as 
race, religion, and disability, with clear and 
effective systems for reporting and addressing 
incidents that students experience.

Instituting these measures can move us towards a 
future in which all students have the opportunity to 
learn and succeed in school, regardless of sexual 
orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. 
And given the decline in supports seen in our 2021 
report, it is imperative that all of us who want safe 
and affirming schools for all students to intensify 
our efforts.

30  U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education 

Statistics, Common Core of Data (CCD), “Table 203.20. Enrollment 
in public elementary and secondary schools, by region, state, and 
jurisdiction: Selected years, fall 1990 through fall 2030.” https://
nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_203.20.asp.

31  To test if the regional representation of our sample differed from 
national public school enrollment, a one-sample chi-square test 
was conducted comparing our observed population numbers 
by region to expected population numbers based on national 
projected enrollment for fall 2018 from the National Center for 
Education Statistics. The test was significant: χ2 = 698.37, df = 
3, p<.001. Examination of expected vs. observed cases within 
region demonstrated that our NSCS 2021 public school sample 
had greater representation in the Northeast and Midwest and 
lower representation in the South and West compared to 2021 
high school enrollment numbers from the National Center for 
Education Statistics. We could not examine enrollment in the U.S. 
territories because data were available only for Puerto Rico and 
the U.S. Virgin Islands. In examining the available data of these 
two territories vis-à-vis the NSCS sample, the NSCS sample had a 
somewhat higher percentage of representation from Puerto Rico in 
NSCS than expected (χ2 = 7.05, df = 1, p<.01. and there was no 
significance regarding the U.S. Virgin Islands. 

32  Sexual orientation was assessed with a multi-check item (i.e., gay, 
lesbian, straight/heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, queer, and 
questioning) with an optional write-in item for sexual orientations 
not listed. Youth were allowed to endorse multiple options. 
Students who endorsed multiple sexual orientations were provided 
with the option to indicate the sexual orientation with which they 

identified most strongly. Mutually exclusive categories were created 
at the data cleaning stage so that analyses could compare youth 
across sexual orientation categories. Students who indicated which 
orientation they identified most strongly with were coded as that 
orientation. For students who endorsed multiple sexual orientations 
and did not choose to indicate which one they most strongly 
identify with, responses were categorized based upon the following 
hierarchy: gay/lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, queer, questioning, 
asexual, and straight/heterosexual. Thus, as an example, if an 
individual identified as “gay” and “queer” they were categorized 
as “gay/lesbian”; if an individual identified as “bisexual” and 
“questioning”, they were categorized as “bisexual.” 

33  Pansexual identity is commonly defined as experiencing attraction 

to some people, regardless of their gender identity. This identity 
may be distinct from a Bisexual identity, which is commonly 
described as either experiencing attraction to some male-identified 
people and some female-identified people or as experiencing 
attraction to some people of the same gender and some people of 
different genders.

34  Asexual identity is defined as not experiencing sexual attraction, 
but possibly experiencing other forms of attraction (e.g., 
intellectual, emotional).

35  Race/ethnicity was assessed with a single multi-check question 

item (i.e., African American or Black; Asian or South Asian; Native 
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; Native American, American 
Indian, or Alaska Native; White or Caucasian; Hispanic or Latino/
Latina/Latinx; and Arab American, Middle Eastern, or North 
African) with an optional write-in item for race/ethnicities not 
listed. Participants who selected more than one race category 
were coded as multiracial, with the exception of participants 
who selected either “Hispanic or Latino/Latina/Latinx” or “Arab 
American, Middle Eastern, or North African” as their ethnicity. 
Participants who selected either one ethnicity were coded as 
that ethnicity, regardless of any additional racial identities they 
selected. Participants who selected both ethnicities were coded as 
multiracial.

36  Latinx is a variant of the masculine “Latino” and feminine 

“Latina” that leaves gender unspecified and, therefore, aims to be 
more inclusive of diverse gender identities, including nonbinary 
individuals. To learn more: https://www.meriam-webster.com/words-
at-play/word-history-latinx

37  Gender was assessed via two items: an item assessing sex assigned 
at birth (i.e., male or female) and an item assessing gender 
identity (i.e., cisgender, transgender, nonbinary, genderqueer, 
male, female, questioning, and an additional write-in option). 
Based on responses to these two items, students’ gender was 
categorized for this analyses as: Cisgender (including cisgender 
male, cisgender female, cisgender nonbinary/genderqueer, or 
unspecified male or female), Transgender (including transgender 
male, transgender female, transgender nonbinary/genderqueer, and 
transgender only), Nonbinary/Genderqueer (including nonbinary, 
genderqueer, nonbinary/genderqueer male, nonbinary/genderqueer 
female, or another nonbinary identity [i.e., those who  who wrote in 
identities such as “genderfluid,” “agender” or “demigender”]) and 
Questioning. Students in the “nonbinary/genderqueer” group did 
not also identify as “transgender.” 

38  Receiving educational accommodations was assessed with a 
question that asked students if they received any educational 
support services at school, including special education classes, 
extra time on tests, resource classes, or other accommodations. 

39  To examine differences across school characteristics (grade 

level, school type, school locale, and region) by type of learning 
environment (online only, hybrd, and in-person only), a series of 
chi-square analyses were performed, and were all significant at 
p<.01. Comparisons between column percentages within each 
school characteristic were considered at p<.01 and indicated in 
the table whereby percentages across a row that share a letter 
are not significantly different and pairs that do not share a letter 
are significantly difference. Grade level: GSAs was significant: χ2 
= 163.11, df = 8, p<.001, Cramer’s V = .06; School type (full 
sample): χ2 = 217.31, df = 4, p<.001, Cramer’s V = .07; Charter 
(within public school sample): χ2 = 45.97, df = 2, p<.001, 
Cramer’s V = .05; Magnet (within public school sample): χ2 = 
69.45, df = 2, p<.001, Cramer’s V = .06; Locale: χ2 = 422.65, 
df = 4, p<.001, Cramer’s V = .10; Region: χ2 = 1022.10, df = 8, 
p<.001, Cramer’s V = .15.

American Samoa).

41  To examine mean differences in reasons why students feel unsafe 

at school, a repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance 
(RMANOVA) was conducted among the following “Do you feel 
unsafe at your school or in your online classes because of…” 
variables: sexual orientation, gender, gender expression, race or 
ethnicity, developmental or physical disability, mental health status 
or emotional disability, religion, body size or weight, family income, 
academic ability, citizenship status, how well one speaks English. 
The multivariate effect was significant, Pillai’s Trace = .676, F 
(12, 22093) = 3848.33, p<.001, ηp
were considered at p < .01, and all pair were significantly 
different except there were no differences between body size or 
weight and gender expression, and between race or ethnicity and 
developmental or physical disability. 

2 = .68. Pairwise comparisons 

42  To assess differences in feeling unsafe for any personal 

characteristic by type of learning environment, an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was performed. F(2, 22102) = 120.07, p<.001, 
2 = .01. Post hoc comparisons were considered at p<.01. 
ηp
Students in online only learning environments were less likely 
to feel unsafe than those in hybrid and in-person only learning 
environments, and students in hybrid learning environments were 
less likely than those in in-person only learning environments.

43  To compare differences by learning environment among the 

2 = .02. 

individual safety variables, a multivariate analysis of variance 
(MANOVA) was performed. The multivariate effect was significant: 
Pillai’s Trace = .04, F(26, 44182) = 36.83, p<.001, ηp
Univariate and bivariate effects were considered at p < .01. Results 
indicated that all variables were significantly different by learning 
environment except for no differences in feeling unsafe because 
of race/ethnicity, physical disability, family income, citizenship 
status, or English ability. Pairwise comparisons across the types 
of learning environments among the variables with a significant 
univariate effect indicated a lower likelihood of feeling unsafe 
for those in online only learning environments than the other two 
groups. Further, results indicated a lower likelihood of feeling safe 
for those in hybrid learning environments, with the exception of no 
differences between the two groups in feeling unsafe because of 
mental health, body size or weight, or academic ability.

44  To examine mean differences in feelings of unsafety, a repeated 
measures multivariate analysis of variance (RMANOVA) was 
conducted among the following When attending school in person, 
do you avoid any of these spaces in school because you feel 
uncomfortable or unsafe in the space?” variables: bathrooms, 
cafeteria or lunch room, locker rooms, hallways/stairwells, school 
athletic fields or facilities, school buses, PE or gym, certain 
classrooms, school grounds. The multivariate effect was significant, 
Pillai’s Trace = .54, F (9, 16613) = 2190.14, p<.001, ηp
.54, for all variables except cafeteria or lunchroom and certain 
classrooms, which were both marginally significant at p<.05, 
hallways/stairwells and school grounds, which was not significant. 

2 = 

45  To compare differences by learning environment among the 

avoiding spaces variables, a multivariate analysis of variance 
(MANOVA) was performed. The multivariate effect was significant: 
Pillai’s Trace = .04, F(10, 16611) =4.26, p<.001, ηp
Univariate and bivariate effects were considered at p < .01. 
The only significant univariate result was with avoiding certain 
classrooms for which those in in-person only learning environments 
was higher than those in hybrid learning environments. 

2 = .003. 

46  To compare differences by learning environment in the number of 

missed days of school for safety reasons, an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was performed: F(10, 16611) =4.26, p<.001, ηp
= .003. Pairwise differences were considered at p < .01, and 
indicated that those in online learning environments had a lower 
mean than those in the other two types of learning environments.

47  Mean differences in the frequencies across types of biased remarks 
were examined using a repeated measures multivariate analysis 
of variance (MANOVA), and percentages are shown for illustrative 
purposes. The multivariate effect was significant. Pillai’s Trace 
= .37, F(4, 22243) = 3223.36, p<.001, and differences were 
significant for all remarks. 

48 

“No homo” is a phrase employed at the end of a statement in order 
to rid it of a potential gay, or “homo” connotation. For instance, 
some might use the phrase after giving a compliment to someone 
of the same gender, as in, “I like your jeans—no homo,” and is 
homophobic in that it assumes that being perceived as gay, or 
“homo,” is something to be avoided.

49  Mean differences in how bothered students were by hearing “gay” 
used in a negative way and “no homo” were examined using a 
paired samples t-test. The difference was significant, t(22257) = 
45.67, p<.001.

50  Mean differences in the frequencies between types of biased 

remarks based on gender expression were examined using a paired 
samples t-test. The difference was significant, t(22257) = 45.66, 
p<.001.

51  Mean differences in the frequencies between homophobic remarks 

and gender expression remarks made by school staff were examined 
using a paired samples t-test. The difference was significant, 
t(20331) = 66.47, p<.001.

52  To assess differences in frequency of hearing anti-LGBTQ+ remarks 
by learning environment (online only, hybrid, or in-person only) 
and multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed 
where frequencies of hearing remarks (remarks (“gay” used in 
a negative way, “no homo,” other homophobic remark, negative 
remarks about gender expression, and negative remarks about 
transgender people) were the independent variables, type of 
learning environment was the dependent variable, and school level, 
school type, region, and locale were controls. The multivariate 
effect was significant: Pillai’s Trace=.04, F(5, 42434)=74.92, 
p<.001. The univariate effect for “gay” used in a negative way 
2=.01. Pairwise 
was significant: F(2, 21220)=108.88, p<.001, ηp
comparisons were considered at p<.01: All learning environments 
were different from each other. The univariate effect for “no homo” 
2=.004. Pairwise 
was significant: F(2, 21220)=41.28, p<.001, ηp
comparisons were considered at p<.01: All learning environments 
were different from each other. The univariate effect for other 
homophobic remarks was significant: F(2, 21220)=150.74, 
p<.001, ηp
All learning environments were different from each other. The 
univariate effect for negative remarks about gender expression 
was significant: F(2, 21220)=9.81, p<.001, ηp
comparisons were considered at p<.01: In-person only was higher 
than online only and hybrid. Hybrid and online were not different. 
The univariate effect for negative remarks about transgender people 
2=.01. Pairwise 
was significant: F(2, 21220)=124.62, p<.001, ηp
comparisons were considered at p<.01: All learning environments 
were different from each other.

53  To assess differences in number of students making homophobic 

remarks and negative remarks about gender expression by learning 
environment, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) 
was performed where amount of students making remarks were the 
dependent variables, learning environment (online only, hybrid, in-

76  For purposes of analysis, we measured victimization by creating 
composite weighted variables for both types of victimization 
(victimization based on sexual orientation and victimization 
based on gender expression) based on the severity of harassment 
with more weight given to more severe forms of harassment. 
Physical assault received the most weight, followed by physical 
harassment, and verbal harassment. To test differences on severity 
of experiences with anti-LGBTQ+ victimization between those 
who reported that they did not report victimization because it 
was “not that serious” and those who did not cite this reason for 
not reporting victimization, two multivariate analyses of variance 
(MANOVA) were conducted. Separate ANOVAs were run for 
in-person victimization experienced by students who attended 
school in person and for online harassment for students who 
attended school online. For in-person victimization, three weighted 
victimization variables (based on sexual orientation, gender, and 
gender expression) were dependent variables. The independent 
variable was dichotomous, where 1 = “not that serious” and “0” 
indicated that students had not cited this reason for not reporting 
victimization to school staff. Multivariate results were significant:

victimization variables (based on sexual orientation, gender, and 
gender expression) were dependent variables. The independent 
variable was dichotomous, where 1 = “not that serious” and “0” 
indicated that students had not cited this reason for not reporting

92  To assess the relationship between anti-LGBTQ+ discriminatory 
school policies/practices and educational aspirations, a partial 
correlation was performed between the variable for having any 
experience of discrimination at school and the variable for plans to 
pursue pos-secondary education, controlling for student grade level: 
partial r(15789) = -.06, p < 001. Percentages mentioned are for 
illustrative purposes.

93  The relationship between GPA and severity of victimization was 
examined through Pearson correlations – in-person victimization 
based on sexual orientation: r(15153) = -.15, p<.001; 
victimization based on gender expression: r(15012) = -.18,

r(17386) = -.16, p<.001.

94  To test differences in academic achievement (GPA) by experiences 
of anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination at school, we conducted an 
independent samples t-test with missing any school as the 
dependent variable, and having experienced discrimination as 
the independent variable. Results were significant: t(18623.76)

Online Victimization: To compare disciplinary experiences by 
severity of online victimization based on sexual orientation, 
gender expression, and gender, a multivariate analysis of variance 
(MANOVA) was performed where frequency of online victimization 
based on sexual orientation, gender expression, and gender were 
the dependent variables, and any experience of school discipline

103  To compare disciplinary experiences by missing school due to 

safety reasons, a partial correlation was performed between the 
variable for having any experience of discrimination and the 
variable for days of missed school in the past month: r(19665) = 
.22, p < 001. Percentages mentioned are for illustrative purposes. 
Students who had experienced discipline was associated with more 
days of missed school for safety reasons.

104  To compare disciplinary experiences by experiences of 

discrimination at school, a chi-square test was conducted using 
a dichotomized variable indicating that students had experienced 
discriminatory policies or procedures  and a dichotomized variable 
regarding having experienced any type of school discipline: χ2 = 
1198.61, df = 1, p<.001, φ = .25. Students who had experienced 
discriminatory policies or practices at school reported higher 
rates of school disciplinary action than students who had not 
experienced these policies or practices.

114  The relationship between self-esteem and severity of in-person 
victimization was examined through Pearson correlations: 
Victimization based on sexual orientation: r(12515) = -.22, 
p<.001; victimization based on gender expression: r(12406) = 
-.25, p<.001; victimization based on gender: r(12391) = -.25,

lower levels of victimization were determined by a mean split 
on each of the three weighted victimization variables, and the 
percentages shown of LGBTQ+ students with “Higher Levels of 
Self-Esteem”  was also determined by a mean split of the self-
esteem scale scores.

107  The relationship between school belonging and severity of online 
anti-LGBTQ+ victimization was examined through Pearson 
correlations – online victimization based on sexual orientation: 
r(16358) = -.34, p<.001; online victimization based on gender 

115  The relationship between depression and severity of in-person

victimization based on gender: r(12648) = .35, p<.001. For 
illustrative purposes, the categories of higher and lower levels of 
victimization were determined by a mean split on each of the three 
weighted victimization variables, and the percentages shown of 
LGBTQ+ students with “Higher Levels of Depression” was also 
determined by a mean split of the depression scale scores.

116  A series of logistic regression models were used to examine 
the association between each of the three types of in-person 
anti-LGBTQ+ victimization at school and considering suicide in 
the past year after adjusting for proportion of school time spent 
in-person: victimization re: sexual orientation – OR = 2.93, p < 
.001; victimization re: gender expression - OR = 3.03, p < .001; 
victimization re: gender - OR = 3.09, p < .001.

117  The relationship between self-esteem and frequency of online 

victimization at school was examined through Pearson correlations: 
victimization based on sexual orientation: r(14125) = -.20, 
p<.001; victimization based on gender expression: r(14073) 
= -.21, p<.001; victimization based on gender: r(14040) = 
-.21, p<.001. For illustrative purposes, the categories of higher 
and lower levels of victimization were determined by creating a 
dichotomous variable of “Never,” “Rarely,” and “Sometimes” 
responses into “Lower Levels of Victimization,” and “Often” 
and “Frequently” into “Higher Levels of Victimization on each 
of the three online victimization variables, and percentages of

121  To test differences in self-esteem by experiences of anti-LGBTQ+ 
discrimination at school, we conducted an independent samples 
t-test with school belonging as the dependent variable, and having 
experienced discrimination as the independent variable. Results 
were significant: t(13899.59) = 30.49, p<.001, Cohen’s d = .49. 
Percentages are shown for illustrative purposes. The percentages 
shown of LGBTQ+ students with “Higher Levels of Self-Esteem”  
was also determined by a mean split of the self-esteem scale 
scores.

122  To test differences in depression by experiences of anti-LGBTQ+ 
discrimination at school, we conducted an independent samples 
t-test with school belonging as the dependent variable, and having

129  A chi-square test was conducted to examine differences in GSA 
availability by type of learning environment: χ2 = 92.57, df = 2, 
p<.001. Percentages shown for illustrative purposes.

130  To learn more about differences by school characteristics, please 

see the “School Climate and School Characteristics” section in 
“Part Three” of this report.

131  Logistic regression was used to examine differences in the 

likelihood of having a GSA by type of learning environment after 
taking into account school characteristics (school type, school 
level, and geographic region and locale of the school). School 
characteristics were entered in the first step which was significant: 
χ2 = 2897.80, df = 11, p<.001. Type of learning environment was 
entered in the second step which was not significant, indicating 
that there was not difference in likelihood of having a GSA after 
accounting for school characteristics.

132  To assess differences in how often students attended a GSA by 

type of learning environment, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was 
performed. The effect as significant, F(2, 7520) = 25.82, p<.001,

135  To assess differences in inclusive curriculum by learning 

environment, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) 
was performed where presence of positive LGBTQ+ representation 
in instruction and presence of negative LGBTQ+ representation in 
instruction were the dependent variables, learning environment 
(online only, hybrid, in-person only) was the independent variable, 
and school level, school type, region, and locale were controls. 
The multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s Trace=.01, F(4, 
41626)=49.18, p<.001. The effect for positive inclusion was 
2 = .00. Pairwise 
significant, F(2, 20813)=40.92, p<.001, ηp
comparisons were considered at, p<.01: In-person only was lower 
than hybrid and online only. Hybrid and online only were not 
different. The effect for negative inclusion was significant, F(2, 
2 = .01. Pairwise comparisons were 
20813)=59.07, p<.001, ηp
considered at, p<.01: All learning environments were different from 
each other.

136  Students in all learning environments were asked about access to 

textbooks and reading materials that contain information about 
LGBTQ+ people, history, or topics. Only students who attended 
school in person (both only in person and hybrid) were asked 
about access to access to LGBQT+ library resources and access to 
LGBTQ+ content via school internet.

137  73.5% of students reported that LGBTQ+ topics were not included 

in any textbooks or other assigned readings and 10.0% reported 
that they did not know if these topics were included. 

138  28.8% of students who attended school in person reported that 

they could not find books or information with LGBTQ+ content in 
their school library, and 28.4% reported that they did not know if 
their library had these resources.

139  To assess differences in inclusive textbooks by learning 

environment, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed 
where presence of positive LGBTQ+ representation in textbooks or 
other readings was the dependent variable, learning environment 
(online only, hybrid, in-person only) was the independent variable, 
and school level, school type, region, and locale were controls. 
The effect was significant: F(2, 20849)=41.25, p<.01, ηp
Pairwise comparisons were considered at, p<.01: In-person only 
was lower than hybrid and online only. Hybrid and online only were 
not different.

140  To assess differences in inclusive library resources and internet 
access by learning environment, a multivariate analysis of 
covariance (MANCOVA) was performed where presence of positive 
LGBTQ+ representation in the school library and via school internet 
access were the dependent variables, learning environment (online 
only, hybrid, in-person only) was the independent variable, and 
school level, school type, region, and locale were controls. The 
multivariate effect was not significant. This analysis only included 
students who attended school in-person only or hybrid, as students 
who attended online only were not asked about library materials 
and internet access at school.

141  To test differences between inclusion of LGB topics and inclusion 
of trans/nonbinary topics, a McNemar Chi-Square test was 
conducted among students who had received sex education. The 
test included two dichotomous variables, indicating whether LGB 
and whether trans/nonbinary topics were positively included in their 
sex education. The results were significant: χ2=706.64, p<.001, ϕ 
= .62.

142  To assess differences in inclusive sex education by learning 

and school level, school type, region, and locale were controls. 
The multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s Trace=.01, F(4,

significant, F(2, 14541)=36.96, p<.001, ηp
comparisons were considered at, p<.01: In-person only was lower 
than hybrid and online only. Hybrid and online only were not 
different. The effect for trans/nonbinary inclusion was significant, 
F(2, 14541)=36.23, p<.001, ηp

multivariate analysis of variance (repeated measures MANOVA), 
with type of school staff as the independent variable and comfort 
level for each of the seven school staff categories as the dependent 
variables. The multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s Trace

significant.

146  To assess differences in comfort level talking to school staff by 

learning environment, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) 
was performed with the set of school personnel variables as 
dependent variables and type of learning environment (online 
only, hybrid, or in-person only) as the independent variable. The 
multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s Trace = .01, F(14,

36106) = 8.50, p<.001, ηp
considered at, p<.01. Results indicated that for all but school 
resource offices, the mean level of comfort was lowest for the 
in-person only group. For school security personnel, there were 
no differences in the means across groups. For school librarians, 
the mean level of comfort for the online only group was also 
significantly higher than the mean for the hybrid group.

147  To examine whether differences in level of comfort with school 
personnel was, in part, related to school characteristics, a 
multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was performed 
with the set of school personnel variables as dependent variables, 
type of learning environment (online only, hybrid, or in-person 
only) as the independent variable, and with school characteristics 
as covariates, specifically region, locale, and school type. The 
multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s Trace = .003, F(14, 
34666) =4.02, p<.001, ηp
considered at, p<.01. After controlling for school characteristics, 
significant mean differences only held for comfort with school 
mental health professionals, comfort with librarians, and comfort 
with school nurses. For comfort with school mental health 
professionals, the mean was highest for the hybrid learning 
environment group and there were no differences between the 
online only and the in-person only groups. For comfort with school 
nurses and comfort with school librarians, the mean was lowest for 
the in-person only group and there were no differences between the 
online only and the hybrid groups.

148  Given the role of school security personnel, only students who 

had had instruction in a school building during the 2020–2021 
school year (whether full-time or part-time) were asked these

150  To compare LGBTQ+ students’ reports of seeing Safe Space 

stickers or posters, a chi-square test was conducted. The test was 
significant: χ2 = 358.98, df = 2, p<.001, Cramer’s V = .13. The 
percentage of students seeing these signs of support was higher 
for the hybrid group than the online only and the in-person only 
groups, and the percentage was higher for the in-person only group 
than the online only group.

151  Note: The generic policy category includes students who explicitly 
said that their school policy included neither sexual orientation or 
gender expression, and also student who said they were unsure if 
their school policy included those protections.

152  To compare LGBTQ+ students’ reports of availability and type of 

anti-bullying/harassment policy at their school by type of learning 
environment (Online Only, Hybrid, and In-Person only) a chi-square 
test was conducted. The test was significant: χ2 = 98.33, df = 6, 
p<.001, Cramer’s V = .07. In-Person Only was less likely than Hybrid 
and Online Only and Hybrid was less likely than In-Person Only to 
report that they had a comprehensive policy; Hybrid was more likely 
than the other groups to have a partially enumerated policy; In-
Person Only was more likely than the other groups to have a generic 
policy, and there were no difference by learning environment is 
having no policy. When controlling for school characteristics (region, 
locale, school type) through a series of logistic regression: 1) with a 
dichotomous dependent variable for presence of a comprehensive 
policy, and 2) with a dichotomous dependent variable for presence 
of a generic policy. Results indicated that these differences held 
after entering school characteristics into the equation on the first 
step: comprehensive policy - χ2 = 22.44, df = 2, p<.001 and generic 
policy - χ2 = 139.04, df = 2, p<.001.

156  To compare LGBTQ+ students’ reports of having a transgender and 

nonbinary policy in their school by type of learning environment 
(Online Only, Hybrid, and In-Person only) a chi-square test was 
conducted. The test was significant: χ2 = 395.28, df = 4, p<.001, 
Cramer’s V = .13. In-Person Only was more likely than others and 
Hybrid was more likely than Online Only to report they did not have a 
policy; In-Person Only was less likely than the other groups to report 
having a policy. Online Only were most likely to report not being 
sure, followed by Hybrid. When controlling for school characteristics 
(region, locale, school type) through logistic regression with a 
dichotomous dependent variable for presence of a transgender 
and nonbinary policy (Yes vs. No/Not Sure), results indicated that 
these differences held after entering school characteristics into the

Percentages are shown for illustrative purposes. In addition, a chi-
square test was conducted to compare the likelihood of having any 
supportive staff at all by presence of a GSA: χ2 = 129.57, df = 2, 
p<.001, ϕ = .12. Students who had a GSA were more likely to have 
at least 1 supportive educator compared to students who did not 
have a GSA.

171  To test differences in academic achievement, an independent-

samples t-test was conducted with presence of a GSA as the 
independent variable, and GPA as the dependent variable. The 
effect was significant: t(15561.16) = -12.54, p<.001, Cohen’s d = 
1.07.

173  GLSEN Days of Action (including Ally Week, No Name-Calling 

Week, and Day of Silence) are national student-led events of 
school-based LGBTQ+ advocacy, coordinated by GLSEN. The Day 
of Silence occurs each year in the spring, and is designed to draw 
attention to anti-LGBTQ+ name-calling, bullying and harassment in 
schools. Visit www.dayofsilence.org for more information.

174  To test differences in GLSEN Days of Action participation by 

presence of a GSA, a chi-square test was conducted: χ2 = 421.70, 
df = 2, p<.001, ϕ = .16. Of the students in our survey with an 
active GSA in their school, 20.4% participated in a GLSEN Day 
of Action in the previous year. Of students without an active GSA, 
9.4% participated.

175  The full breakdown of student responses to the question, “In 

general, how accepting do you think students at your school are 
of LGBTQ+ people?” was as follows: not at all accepting: 5.1%, 
not very accepting: 28.0%, neutral: 26.4%, somewhat accepting: 
30.6%, very accepting: 9.9%.

176  To test differences in peer acceptance and the availability of a GSA, 
a t-test was conducted, with presence of a GSA as the independent 
variable and peer acceptance as the dependent variable. The effect 
was significant: t(15384.50) = -39.14, p<.001. Percentages are 
shown for illustrative purposes. 

177  To test differences in peer intervention by presence of a GSA, we 
conducted a t-test with each of the student intervention variables 
by presence of GSA in school. Both were significant: intervention in 
homophobic remarks – t(13983.25) = -3.78, p<.001, intervention 
in negative gender remarks – t(12555.38) = -4.55, p<.001. 

178  To test differences in school belonging and presence of a GSA, a 
t-test was conducted, with presence of a GSA as  the independent 
variable and school belonging as the dependent variable. The effect 
was significant: t(14030.18) = -33.55, p<.001. 

179  To test differences in well-being and presence of a GSA a 

multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted, with 
the presence of a GSA as the independent variable, and depression 
and self-esteem as the dependent variables. The multivariate 
effect was significant: Pillai’s trace = .02, F(2, 16693) = 164.31, 
p<.001, ηp
depression and self-esteem were both significant. Depression: F(1,

180  A logistic regression model was used to examine the association of 

presence of a GSA and considering suicide in the past year after 
adjusting for proportion of school time spent in-person. The model 
indicated that the presence of a GSA was associated with a lower 
likelihood of considering suicide: OR = .62, p < .001.

199  The relationships between number of supportive staff, and feeling 

unsafe at school and missing school due to feeling unsafe were 
examined through Pearson correlations – Feeling unsafe regarding 
their sexual orientation: r(20205) = -.24, p<.001; Feeling unsafe 
because of their gender expression: r(20205) = -.15, p<.001; 
Feeling unsafe because of their gender: r(20205) = -.15, p<.001;  
Number of school days missed because of feeling unsafe: r(20205) 
= -.20, p<.001.

200  To assess the relationship between number of supportive staff 

2 = .01. Post hoc comparisons 

and educational aspirations, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was 
performed where number of supportive staff was the dependent 
variable, and educational aspirations was the independent variable: 
F(5, 19565) = 50.69, p<.001, ηp
were considered at, p<.01. All differences between levels of 
educational aspiration were significant, with the exception of 
no significant difference in the number of supportive educators 
between “Vocational, Trade, or Technical School” and “Associate’s 
Degree.” Overall, results indicate that a greater number of 
supportive educators is associated with a greater number of years 
planned for post-secondary education – “Less than High School” 
reported the fewest number of supportive educators and “Graduate 
Degree” reported the highest number of educators. (Vocational or 
technical programs and Associate’s degree programs often take 
the same amount of time to complete, which is consistent with the 
pattern found across aspiration levels.) 

201  The relationship between number of supportive staff and GPA was 
examined through Pearson correlations: r(20156) = .08, p<.001. 

THE 2021 NATIONAL SCHOOL CLIMATE SURVEY202  The relationship between number of supportive staff and school 
belonging was examined through Pearson correlations: r(19010) 
=.45, p<.001.

203  The relationship between number of supportive staff and self-
esteem was examined through Pearson correlations: r(16547) 
=.19, p<.001.

204  The relationship between number of supportive staff and 

depression was examined through Pearson correlations: r(16883) 
=-.21, p<.001.

205  A series of logistic regression models was used to examine 

the association between number of supportive educators and 
considering suicide in the past year after adjusting for proportion 
of school time spent in-person. The main model, using the full 
interval variable for number of supportive educators, indicated that 
an increase of supportive educators was associated with a lower 
likelihood of considering suicide: OR = .75, p < .001. Having 6 
or more supportive educators was associated with a 42% lower 
likelihood of having seriously considered suicide (OR = .58, p < 
.001), and having 11 or more supportive educators was associated 
with a 44% lower likelihood of seriously considering suicide (OR = 
.56, p < .001).

206  To examine staff intervention regarding anti-LGBTQ+ remarks, we 
created a composite variable of the frequency of staff response to 
homophobic remarks and frequency of staff response to gender-
biased remarks, which used the higher value of the two when they 
differed. The relationship between feeling unsafe because of sexual 
orientation, gender, or gender expression and frequency of school 
staff intervention was examined through point biserial correlations 
– unsafe re: sexual orientation: r(18792) = -.13, p<.001; unsafe 
re: gender expression: r(18792) = -.06, p<.001; unsafe re: gender: 
r(18792) = -.09, p<.001.

207  The relationship between missing school due to feeling unsafe 

and frequency of school staff intervention regarding anti-LGBTQ+ 
remarks was examined through Pearson correlations: r(18895) = 
-.07, p<.001.

208  In the NSCS we asked students about the last time they reported 
victimization experiences to staff, how staff responded, and how 
effective that response was. Although we only asked students 
about how effective staff were the last time they responded to 
victimization, we used this as a proxy measure in this section for 
how effective staff are, in general, when responding to LGBTQ+ 
students’ reports of victimization.

209  The relationship between feeling unsafe regarding their sexual 

orientation, gender expression or gender and effectiveness of staff 
intervention was examined through point biserial correlations – 
unsafe re: sexual orientation: r(5237) = -.18, p<.001; unsafe re: 
gender expression: r(5237) = -.12, p<.001; unsafe re: gender: 
r(5237) = -.15, p<.001.

210  The relationship between missing school due to feeling unsafe or 

uncomfortable and effectiveness of staff intervention was examined 
through a Pearson correlation: r(5258) = -.20, p<.001. 

211  To examine the relationship between in-person victimization 

and effectiveness of staff intervention Pearson correlations were 
conducted: victimization based on sexual orientation: r(4024) = 
-.22, p<.001; victimization based on gender expression: r(3989) 
= -.21, p<.001; victimization based on gender: r(3974) = -.20, 
p<.001. 

212  To examine the relationship between online victimization and 

effectiveness of staff intervention Pearson correlations were 
conducted: victimization based on sexual orientation: r(4467) = 
-.23, p<.001; victimization based on gender expression: r(4444) 
= -.22, p<.001; victimization based on gender: r(4435) = -.20, 
p<.001. 

213  To test differences in number of supportive educators by presence 
of Safe Space stickers/posters, an independent-samples t-test 
was conducted with Safe Space sticker/poster presence as the 
independent variable, and number of supportive staff as the 
dependent variable. The effect was significant: t(17290.51) = 
63.75, p<.001, Cohen’s d = .80.

214  To test differences in anti-LGBTQ+ language by type of school 
policy, a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was 
conducted, with policy type as the independent variable and 
frequency of hearing each type of anti-LGBTQ+ remarks as the 
dependent variables. To examine negative remarks about gender, 
we created a composite variable for hearing negative gender, 

2 = .01; Negative remarks about

multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s trace = .02, F(15, 
65877) = 32.82, p<.001. All univariate effects were significant 
– “Gay” used in a negative way: F(3, 21961) = 138.37, p<.001,

transgender people: F(3, 16625) = 61.14, p<.001, ηp
Post-hoc comparisons were considered at, p<.01. All types of 
anti-LGBTQ+ remarks were least frequently heard by those students 
with comprehensive policies. For use of  “gay” in a negative way, 
all policy types were significantly different: those with no policy 
reported the highest frequency followed by those having a partially 
enumerated policy and then those with a generic policy. For use 
of the expression “no homo” and negative remarks about gender 
expression, there were no differences between having no policy, a 
generic policy, and a partially enumerated policy. For other types of 
homophobic remarks and for negative remarks about transgender 
people, those with no policy reported the highest frequencies of 
these remarks, but there were no differences between having a 
generic policy and a partially enumerated policy.

215  To test differences in rates of staff intervention regarding anti-

LGBTQ+ language by type of school policy, a series of analyses 
of variance (ANOVAs) were conducted, with policy type as the 
independent variable and frequency of intervention regarding 
homophobic remarks and intervention regarding negative remarks 
about gender expression as the dependent variables. The univariate 
effects of policy type on both types of intervention were significant 
– intervention regarding homophobic language: F(3, 16697) 
= 165.49, p<.001, ηp
remarks about gender expression: F(3, 16697) = 149.98, p<.001, 
2 = .03. Post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons were considered 
ηp
at, p<.01. For both types of interventions, students in schools 
with comprehensive policies reported the most frequent teacher 
intervention, followed by those in schools with partially enumerated 
policies, followed by those in schools with a generic policy, and 
lastly followed by those in schools with no policy. Percentages of 
staff intervention “most of the time” or “always” are shown for 
illustrative purposes.

victimization based on sexual orientation, in-person victimization 
based on gender expression, and in-person victimization based on 
gender) as the dependent variables. The multivariate effect was 
significant: Pillai’s trace = .01, F(9, 47595) = 15.18, p<.001.The

hoc comparisons were considered at, p<.01. For all three types 
of victimization, students in schools with comprehensive policies 
experienced the least victimization and those in schools with no 
policies experienced the most victimization, with the exception 
that the difference between having a partially enumerated policy 
and a comprehensive policy was marginally significant at p = .10 
for in-person victimization based on gender. For all three types 
on in-person victimization, there were no significant differences 
between having a partially enumerated policy and a generic policy. 
Percentages of students experiencing “higher levels” (i.e., higher 
than the average of the survey sample) of victimization are shown 
for illustrative purposes.

217  To test differences in online victimization by type of school policy, 
a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted, with 
policy type as the independent variable and experiences of online 
anti-LGBTQ+ victimization (online victimization based on sexual 
orientation, online victimization based on gender expression, and 
online victimization based on gender) as the dependent variables. 
The multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s trace = .01, F(9, 
56352) = 12.14, p<.001. The univariate effect of policy type was 
significant for all three types of victimization – online victimization

online anti-LGBTQ+ victimization, those who were in schools with 
no anti-bullying and harassment policy reported the highest levels 
of all three types of online victimization, and those who were in 
schools with a generic policy reported greater online victimization 
than those with a comprehensive policy. However, those who had a 
partially enumerated policy did not differ in the severity of online 
victimization from those with a generic policy and those who had a 
comprehensive policy.

218  To test differences in rates of student reporting of victimization 

incidents to staff by type of school policy, an analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was conducted, with policy type as the independent 
variable and frequency of student reporting of victimization to staff 
as the dependent variable. The main effect of policy type on rates 
2 = 
of reporting was significant: F(3, 13567) = 36.38, p<.001, ηp
.01. Post-hoc Bonferroni comparisons were considered at, p<.01. 
The mean for reporting was significantly different across all four 
policy groups: students in schools with a comprehensive policy had 
a higher mean than all other students, students in schools with 
a partially enumerated policy had a higher mean than those with 
a generic policy or no policy, and those in schools with a generic 
policy had a higher mean than those in schools with no policy. 
Percentages of students reporting victimization incidents to school 
staff “most of the time” or “always” are shown for illustrative 
purposes.

219  To test differences in effectiveness of staff intervention regarding 
victimization incidents by type of school policy, an analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) was conducted, with policy type as the 
independent variable and effectiveness of staff intervention as the 
dependent variable. The main effect of policy type on effectiveness 
2 =  
of intervention was significant: F(3, 5190)=39.99, p<.001, ηp
.02. Post-hoc comparisons were considered at, p<.01. Students in 
schools with a comprehensive policy and students in schools with 
a partially enumerated policy were more likely to report effective 
staff intervention than students in schools with a generic policy and 
students in schools with no policy, and students in schools with no 
policy were least likely to report effective intervention. Students 
having a partially enumerated policy at school was marginally 
statistically different than having a comprehensive policy or a 
generic policy (p < .05). Percentages of students reporting that 
staff intervention regarding victimization incidents was “somewhat” 
or “very” effective are shown for illustrative purposes.

220  To compare number of days having missed school in past month 
due to feeling unsafe or uncomfortable by presence of supportive 
transgender and nonbinary policies among transgender and 
nonbinary students, an independent-samples t-test was conducted. 
The effect was significant: t(1337.50) = 5.35, p<.001, Cohen’s d 
= .16. Percentages are discussed for illustrative purposes.

221  To compare means of school belonging by presence of supportive 
transgender and nonbinary policies among transgender and 
nonbinary students, an independent-samples t-test was conducted. 
The effect was significant: t(1070.83) =20.46, p<.001, Cohen’s d 
= .74. Percentages are discussed for illustrative purposes.

222  A series of chi-square analyses were conducted to examine the 

relationship between presence of school transgender and nonbinary 
student policies/guidelines and experiences with gender-related 
discrimination among transgender and nonbinary students: 1) 
prevented from using chosen name or pronouns – χ2 = 398.16, 
df = 1, p<.001, ϕ = -.20; 2) prevented from using bathrooms 
with one’s gender - χ2 = 334.78, df = 1, p<.001, ϕ = -.20: 3) 
prevented from using locker rooms consistent with one’s gender - χ2 
= 210.08, df = 1, p<.001, ϕ = -.17; 4) prevented from wearing 
clothing considered inappropriate based on gender - χ2 = 194.41, 
df = 1, p<.001, ϕ = -.14; 5) prevented from playing on the school 
sports team that is consistent with one’s gender - χ2 = 95.00, df = 
1, p<.001, ϕ = -.11. The incidence of each type of discrimination 
was significantly lower for those students whose school had 
transgender and nonbinary student policies or guidelines.

223  A logistic regression model was used to examine the association 

between whether school transgender and nonbinary student policy 
or guideline addressed use of names or pronouns or addressed 
changing official school records after a name or gender and the 
likelihood of experiencing discrimination related to name or 
pronoun use at school. The variables indicating whether the policy 
or guideline addressed use of names or pronouns were entered in 
the final step of the equation, after type of learning environment 
(online only, hybrid, in-person only) and all other stipulations 
of the transgender student policy or guideline. Thus, we would 
be able to examine the unique contribution of these specific 

characteristics of the policy or guideline above and beyond all 
other characteristics of the policy or guideline. The final step of the 
equation was significant (χ2 = 30.68, df = 2, p<.001) and the odds 
ratios indicated that having a policy or guideline that addressed 
use of names or pronouns was associated with a lower likelihood 
of experiencing discrimination related to name or pronoun use at 
school: OR = .29, p < .001, and having a policy or guideline that 
addressed changing names or pronouns on official records was also 
associated with a lower likelihood of this form of discrimination: OR 
= .59, p < .01.

224  A logistic regression model was used to examine the association 

between whether school transgender and nonbinary student policy 
or guideline addressed dress codes or uniforms and the likelihood 
of experiencing discrimination related to clothing use. The variable 
indicating whether the policy or guideline addressed clothing 
use was entered in the final step of the equation, after type of 
learning environment (online only, hybrid, in-person only) and all 
other stipulations of the transgender student policy or guideline. 
Thus, we would be able to examine the unique contribution of 
this specific characteristic of the policy or guideline above and 
beyond all other characteristics. The final step of the equation 
was significant (χ2 = 4.08, df = 2, p<.001) and the odds ratio 
indicated that having a policy or guideline that addressed clothing 
use was associated with a lower likelihood of clothing-related 
discrimination: OR = .53, p < .001. Note: the standard of p < .05 
was used for these analyses rather than the more restrictive p < .01 
used throughout most of this report because the subsample for this 
analysis was a fraction of the size of the full sample.

225  A logistic regression model was used to examine the association 

between whether school transgender and nonbinary student policy 
or guideline use of gendered bathrooms and use of a gender-neutral 
bathroom and the likelihood of experiencing discrimination related 
to bathroom use at school. The variables indicating whether the 
policy or guideline addressed bathroom use were entered in the 
final step of the equation, after type of learning environment 
(online only, hybrid, in-person only) and all other stipulations 
of the transgender student policy or guideline. Thus, we would 
be able to examine the unique contribution of these specific 
characteristics of the policy or guideline above and beyond all 
other characteristics of the policy or guideline. The final step of the 
equation was significant (χ2 = 38.91, df = 2, p<.001) and the odds 
ratios indicated that having a policy or guideline that addressed 
use of gendered bathrooms was associated with a lower likelihood 
of experiencing discrimination related bathroom use at school: OR 
= .35, p < .001, and having a policy or guideline that addressed 
use of gender-neutral bathrooms was also associated with a lower 
likelihood of this form of discrimination: OR = .55, p < .01.

226  A logistic regression model was used to examine the association 
between whether school transgender and nonbinary student 
policy or guideline addressed locker room use and the likelihood 
of experiencing discrimination related to locker rooms. The 
variable indicating whether the policy or guideline locker rooms 
use was entered in the final step of the equation, after type of 
learning environment (online only, hybrid, in-person only) and all 
other stipulations of the transgender student policy or guideline. 
Thus, we would be able to examine the unique contribution of 
this specific characteristic of the policy or guideline above and 
beyond all other characteristics. The final step of the equation 
was significant (χ2 = 14.55, df = 2, p<.001) and the odds 
ratio indicated that having a policy or guideline that addressed 
clothing use was associated with a lower likelihood of locker room 
discrimination: OR = .36, p < .001. 

227  A logistic regression model was used to examine the association 
between whether school transgender and nonbinary student 
policy or guideline addressed sports team participation and the 
likelihood of experiencing discrimination related to sports. The 
variable indicating whether the policy or guideline addressed sports 
teams was entered in the final step of the equation, after type of 
learning environment (online only, hybrid, in-person only) and all 
other stipulations of the transgender student policy or guideline. 
Thus, we would be able to examine the unique contribution of 
this specific characteristic of the policy or guideline above and 
beyond all other characteristics. The final step of the equation 
was significant (χ2 = 18.88, df = 2, p<.001) and the odds ratio 
indicated that having a policy or guideline that addressed sports 
teams was associated with a lower likelihood of sports-related 
discrimination: OR = .26, p < .001.

233  To examine differences in outness to peers and outness to staff by 

sexual orientation, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) 
was conducted with degree of outness to peers and degree of 
outness to staff as the dependent variables, sexual orientation as 
the independent variable, and age and gender as controls. The 
multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s Trace = .02, F(12,

by sexual orientation, a chi square test was conducted. The test

237  Sexual orientation was assessed with a multi-check item (i.e., 
gay, lesbian, straight/heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, queer, 
and questioning) with an optional write-in item for sexual 
orientations not listed. Youth were allowed to endorse multiple 
options. Students who endorsed multiple sexual orientations were 
provided with the option to indicate which sexual orientation they 
most strongly identified with.  Mutually exclusive categories were 
created at the data cleaning stage so that analyses could compare 
youth across sexual orientation categories. Students who indicated 
which orientation they identified most strongly with were coded 
as that orientation. For students who endorsed multiple sexual 
orientations and did not choose to indicate which one they most 
strongly identify with, responses were categorized based upon 
the following hierarchy: gay/lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, queer, 
questioning, and straight/heterosexual. Thus, as an example, if an 
individual identified as “gay” and “queer” they were categorized 
as “gay/lesbian”; if an individual identified as “bisexual” and 
“questioning”, they were categorized as “bisexual”. In addition 
to the list of sexual orientation options students could choose, 
students were also provided with the opportunity to write in a 
sexual orientation that was not included in the list of options. 
Most write-in responses were able to be coded into one of the 
listed sexual orientations. A small portion of the total sample 
indicated that they identified with a sexual orientation other than 
the ones listed (0.4%). Of these, some defined themselves as 
some form as “flexible,” (e.g., “homo-flexible”) and others refused 
to label themselves altogether (e.g., “I love who I love”). Another 
group, made up predominantly of students with nonbinary gender 
identities, defined their sexual identity in terms of solely the gender 
identity or expressions of others, without reference to their own 
gender (i.e., ‘androsexual’ or ‘gynosexual’ individuals - those who 
have sexual feelings towards men or women, respectively). Given 
that these categories do not comprise a meaningful group and that 
they account for such a small portion of the sample, we did not 
include these students in this analysis examining differences based 
on sexual orientation.

238  To compare experiences of feeling unsafe at school by sexual 

orientation, a multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) was 
conducted with three unsafe variables (feeling unsafe because of 
sexual orientation, feeling unsafe because of gender expression and 
feeling unsafe because of gender) as dependent variables, sexual 
orientation as the independent variable, and age, outness (to peers 
and to staff), and gender as controls. The multivariate effect was 
significant: Pillai’s Trace = .02, F(15, 48408) = 23.01, p<.001. 
The univariate effect for feeling unsafe regarding sexual orientation 
2 = .01. Pairwise 
was significant: F(5, 16136) = 54.96, p<.001, ηp
comparisons were considered at p<.01: gay or lesbian was different 
from all other sexual orientations and asexual was different from all 
other sexual orientations, with the exception of questioning. There 
were no other group differences. The univariate effect for feeling 
unsafe regarding on gender expression was significant: F(5, 16136)

p<.01: bisexual was different from gay or lesbian, pansexual, 
and queer, asexual was different from gay or lesbian, queer and 
pansexual. There were no other group differences. The univariate 
effect for feeling unsafe regarding gender identity was significant:

victimization based on sexual orientation, weighted victimization 
based on gender expression and weighted victimization based 
on gender) as dependent variables, sexual orientation as the 
independent variable, and age, outness (to peers and to staff), 
and gender as controls. Only students who had been in school 
in-person at some point during the academic years were included 
in the analyses. The multivariate effect was significant: Pillai’s

240  To examine differences in experiences of sexual harassment 

by sexual orientation, an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was 
conducted with sexual harassment as the dependent variable, 
sexual orientation as the independent variable, and age, outness 
(to peers and to staff), and gender as controls. The effect was 
2 = .01. Pairwise 
significant: F(5, 11868) = 21.89, p<.001, ηp
comparisons were considered at p<.01: pansexual was different

241  To compare experiences of online anti-LGBTQ+ harassment 
by sexual orientation, a multivariate analysis of covariance 
(MANCOVA) was conducted with three online harassment variables 
(based on sexual orientation, based on gender expression and

248  Gender was assessed via two items: an item assessing sex assigned 
at birth (i.e., male or female) and an item assessing gender identity 
(i.e., cisgender, transgender, nonbinary, genderqueer, male, 
female, questioning, and an additional write-in option). Based on 
responses to these two items, students’ gender was categorized for 
this analyses as: Cisgender (including cisgender male, cisgender 
female, cisgender nonbinary/genderqueer, or unspecified male or 
female), Transgender (including transgender male, transgender 
female, transgender nonbinary/genderqueer, and transgender 
only), Nonbinary (including nonbinary, genderqueer, nonbinary/
genderqueer male, nonbinary/genderqueer female, or another 
nonbinary identity (i.e., those who wrote in identities such as 
“genderfluid,” “agender” or “demigender”) and Questioning.

item (i.e., African American or Black; Asian or South Asian; Native 
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander; Native American, American 
Indian, or Alaska Native; White or Caucasian; Hispanic or Latino/
Latina/Latinx; and Arab American, Middle Eastern, or North

were coded as multiracial, with the exception of participants 
who selected either “Hispanic or Latino/Latina/Latinx” or “Arab 
American, Middle Eastern, or North African” as their ethnicity. 
Participants who selected either one ethnicity were coded as 
that ethnicity, regardless of any additional racial identities they 
selected. Participants who selected both ethnicities were coded 
as multiracial. The resulting racial/ethnic groupings were: MENA, 
AAPI, Black, Latinx, Native and Indigenous, multiracial, and White.

349  To examine differences on experiences of anti-LGBTQ+ 

discriminatory policies and practices by region, an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was conducted with experiences of any anti-
LGBTQ+ discrimination (a combined variable of whether the 
student experienced any of the discriminatory actions assessed [see 
Discriminatory Practices and Policies section]) as the dependent 
variable and region (South, Midwest, West, Northeast) as the 
independent variable. The results of the analysis were significant:

350  To examine differences on access to GSAs, inclusive curriculum, 

inclusive curricular resources, and comprehensive anti-bullying/
harassment and supportive trans/nonbinary policies by region, 
a series of chi-square tests were conducted. (For the purposes 
of this analysis and similar analyses in this section regarding 
school differences in availability of comprehensive policy, we 
examined only whether students reported that their school had a 
comprehensive, i.e., fully enumerated, anti-bullying/harassment 
policy or not. Therefore, students without a comprehensive policy 
might have had a partially enumerated policy, a generic policy, or 
no policy at all). The effect for GSAs was significant: χ2 = 1392.15,

356  Although we have been collecting NSCS data since 1999, the 
first survey differed slightly from all subsequent surveys in the 

comprehensiveness of the survey questions and in the methods. 
Thus, we did not include it in these over-time comparisons. Even 
though the survey is slightly modified with each installment to 
reflect new or emerging concerns about school climate for LGBTQ+ 
students, it has remained largely the same and has used virtually 
the same data collection methods from 2001 to 2021. For 
LGBTQ+ students who had been in in-person learning environments 
for the entire academic year, the survey questions for 2021 were 
similar than for LGBTQ+ students in prior years of the survey. For 
those who had been in online only or hybrid learning environments, 
the survey included more questions about the online learning 
environment and online harassment. 

357  To examine differences across years in use of anti-LGBTQ+ 

language, a series of one-way analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) 
were performed. Given certain demographic differences among 
the samples across the years, we controlled for participation in a 
community group or program for LGBTQ+ youth, age, racial/ethnic 
group, gender, sexual orientation, and method of taking the survey 
(paper vs. internet version). Because the geographic locations 
varies somewhat across survey years, we controlled for region and 
locale. Further, we controlled for type of learning instructions 
(online only, hybrid, or in-person only), such that all years prior to 
2021 were coded as being in in-person only learning environments.  
These individual-level covariates were chosen based on preliminary 
analysis that examined what school characteristics and personal 
demographics were most predictive of survey year membership. 
Because there were more cases in recent survey years that were 
missing on demographic information, we also included a dummy 
variable controlling for missing demographics. Because of the large 
sample size for all years combined, a more restrictive p-value was 
used when determining statistical significance, p<.001.

To examine differences across years in the use of other homophobic 
remarks (e.g., “fag,” “dyke”), an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
was performed, controlling for demographic and method 
differences across the survey years. The main effect for Survey Year 
was significant, indicating mean differences across years: F(10,

368  To test differences across years in the experiences of victimization 

based on sexual orientation, a multivariate analysis of covariance 
was conducted with the three harassment/assault based on sexual 
orientation variables as dependent variables. In order to account 
for differences in sampling methods across years, youth group 
participation, age, race/ethnicity, and survey method were used 
as covariates. In 1999, frequency of harassment and assault was 
assessed using a 4-point scale, and in the subsequent year, a 
5-point scale was used. To accommodate these differences for this 
variable, we examined differences in the frequency of reporting 
“Frequently.” The multivariate results were significant: Pillai’s 
Trace=.056, F(30, 284502) = 179.24, p<.001. Univariate effects 
and subsequent post-hoc comparisons were considered at, p<.001.

373  The set of discrimination variables has changed over the years. In 

2013, the set included 9 types of discrimination. In 2015, the 
list was expanded to 12 items. For the over-time analyses, we only 
examined the 9 types of discrimination that occurred in all years 
of the survey. In 2015, we added questions about sports-related 
discrimination and about being prevented from raising LGBTQ+ 
issues in extracurricular activities. In 2017, we also split the single 
question about discrimination regarding bathrooms and locker rooms 
into two separate questions. But for analysis over time, we combined 
the two variables about discrimination regarding bathrooms and 
regarding locker rooms so the data from 2017, 2019 and 2021 
would be consistent with the data from 2013 and 2015.

391  A variety of strategies were used to target LGBTQ+ adolescents via 
Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat ads: ads were shown to 13- to 
18-year-olds, who indicated that they were interested in causes, 
events, or organizations specifically related to LGBTQ+ community 
or topics, or who were “friends” of those who followed one of 
the GLSEN-related Facebook/Instagram pages. Advertising on 
Instagram also involved videos of LGBTQ+ students from GLSEN’s 
National Student Council promoting the survey study. In order to 
be included in the final sample, respondents had to have identified 
as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer or as a sexual 
orientation or gender that would fall under the LGBTQ+ “umbrella” 
(e.g., pansexual, questioning, genderqueer).

393  Comparisons between the racial/ethnic composition of the NSCS 

2021 sample with the unweighted population-based data from 
the CDC 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) of those youth 
who indicated something other than “straight/heterosexual” as 
their sexual orientation indicated: 1) our percentage of Black/
African American LGBQ (3.3%) students was lower than the YRBS 
percentage of Black/African American LGBQ (16.4%); 2) our 
percentage of Hispanic/Latinx LGBQ students (16.2%) was lower 
than the YRBS percentage (23.1%), 3) our percentage of White 
LGBQ students (67.3%) was higher than the YRBS percentage 
(46.6%); and 4) our percentage of LGBTQ+ AAPI (3.5%) and 
Native  (0.5%) students were similar but significantly different 
from the YRBS percentage (5.8% and 1.4%, respectively), and 
5) our percentage of LGBTQ+ Multiracial (8.2%) students was 
higher than the YRBS percentage (6.7%). Although the YRBS 
data provides the closest estimate for NSCS data (as they are 
both national percentages of secondary school students), there 
are key differences between these samples to bear in mind when 
considering comparisons — as noted in the text, racial/ethnic 
identity is captured differently by the NSCS and YRBS, and YRBS 
data is from 2019 whereas NSCS data is from 2021. Furthermore, 
the NSCS sample consists of both middle and high school 
students, whereas the national YRBS sample consist of only high 
school students. Finally, the full NSCS sample includes transgender 
and other nonbinary students, and there is no population-based 
national data of transgender and nonbinary students with which 
to compare the NSCS sample. Center for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC). YRBSS Data & Documentation. Available at:

394  Hispanic/Latinx and Arab American/Middle Eastern/North African 

categories were considered ethnicities as opposed to races, and 
thus students selecting either of those categories were coded 
as such, regardless of race (e.g., students selecting “African 
American” and “Latino/a” were coded as “Latino/a”).
