About the Study 

While progress has been made toward achieving equality and equity across Maryland and the United 
States, significant work remains. Our LGBTQIA+ community still faces challenges in almost every aspect of 
daily life, from housing, employment, healthcare, and education, while living with increased risks of 
discrimination, harassment, and violence. 

The Maryland Commission on LGBTQ Affairs collects data from groups across the State engaging in needs 
assessments that articulate the needs of LGBTQIA+ Marylanders; however, no needs assessments have 
been completed on the Eastern Shore in recent years. Accordingly, to generate meaningful data and as part 
of an ongoing commitment to serving the LGBTQIA+ community on the Eastern Shore, Salisbury PFLAG 
administered an online needs assessment survey. 

The survey was designed and administered by a faculty member at the University of Maryland Eastern 
Shore with an expertise in both survey design, needs assessments, and diversity equity and inclusion. 
Accordingly, the survey was approved by, and registered with, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore 
Institutional Review Board.  

The survey was prepared within a professional online survey system and included a combination of 
dichotomous, Likert-scaled, slider scale, ordinal,  short answer, and contingency questions. The Flesh 
Kincaid formula was applied to ensure readability for the population under consideration. Next, a basic 
psychometric review of the survey was conducted by a panel that included an assessment expert, multiple 
subject matter experts, several LGBTQIA+ community leaders, a psychologist, and a survey methodologist. 
The purpose of the panel was to examine the survey for validity and effectiveness and provide structured 
feed-back to the researcher. Following revisions, a second panel was established to provide an additional 
review and feedback. Finally, the survey 
was pilot-tested before implementation 
and then modified accordingly before 
widespread distribution. 

The survey was administered online 
between June and August of 2023. The 
survey was promoted via a flyer 
containing a QR code at Salibury Pride, 
disseminated via PFLAG Salisbury social 
media pages, and distributed via email 
with a unique URL per participant to the 
PFLAG Salisbury mailing list. No identifying 
information was collected about 
participants and once the survey closed, 
the data was cleaned and exported for 
analyses. 

Two hundred eighty three individuals 
completed the survey representing 
multiple counties  including the Eastern 
Shore of Maryland and Southern 
Delaware.  

 
 
Executive Summary 

PFLAG Salisbury was formed in 2015 and has been making a difference in the community since it was 
founded. Highlights include introducing Maryland's first rainbow, trans pride, and progress pride 
crosswalks; establishing the Salisbury Pride Parade and Festival; working with the City of Salisbury on Pride 
on the Plaza; organizing community art projects; influencing the passage of a gender-neutral bathroom 
ordinance in the City of Salisbury; engaging in legislative advocacy in Annapolis; hosting monthly meetings 
and other community-building events; and much more. 

PFLAG Salisbury serves the largest geographic area of any PFLAG chapter in Maryland. This area includes 
Dorchester, Wicomico, Worcester, and Somerset counties, a rural region significantly distanced from 
mainland Maryland, facing ever-growing disparities when it comes to resources for the LGBTQIA+ 
community. 

The 2023 Delmarva LGBTQIA+ Climate Survey provides a snapshot of the queer community on the Eastern 
Shore. This initiative is propelled by advances in LGBTQIA+ rights in the Maryland legislature, which are co-
occurring with the erosion of the civil liberties of LGBTQIA+ Americans in conservative states. Highlights of 
the findings are as follows: 

•  A resounding statistic from the survey is that when asked to rank the inclusiveness of the 

community on the Eastern Shore for LGBTQIA+ people from 0 to 100, the average score was a 54 
•  Respondents were generally satisfied with access to local government and available public services 
but were dissatisfied when it came to saftey for LGBTQIA+ individuals, support for LGBTQIA+ 
families, and interactions with police. 

•  Participants indicated that they were dissatisfied with support for 
LGBTQIA+ individuals, parents, elders, and transgender youth and 
adults. 

•  A consistent theme running throughout the results was the lack of 
sufficient medical care for transgender and gender non-conforming 
individuals. 

•  Overwhelmingly, respondents do not consider schools on the Eastern 
Shore to be safe for LGBTQIA+ youth. This sentiment while strong 
amoung all respondents was especially intense among participants 
who identified as transgender or gender non conforming. 

•  Respondents indicated disatisfaction when it came to general access 
to healthcare, gender affirming care, mental health services, and 
reproductive care. 

•  Semantic analysis of a qualitive short answer question related to 

health care found the greatest isues to be a lack of providers, discrimination and/or bias from 
providers, long waits for appointments, far distances needed to travel to access providers, issues 
with cost, and providers lacking knowledge about the LGBTQIA+ community. 

•  Semantic analyis of a short response question designed to gauge perceived commuity needs found 
that the most common themes were medical services, support/resource/advocacy, mental health 
services, support for LGBTQIA+ youth in local schools, a LGBTQIA+ community center, more 
LGBTQIA+ groups, a lack of social activities, more education/training/knowledge, and resources and 
a shelter for unhoused LGBTQIA+ individuals. 

While these results are unsurprising, they are a strong indicator that more work and an expansion of 
services are needed on the lower Eastern Shore.

Participant Perceptions 

Participants were asked to rank their perception of how inclusion the community is for LGBTQIA+ indiciduals 
on a scale from zero (hostile and unwelcoming) to one hundred (extremely inclusive). The average of the 
responses was a 54. 

Participants were asked to reflect on their level of satisfaction with respect to their community by responding 
to a series of five-point Likert scaled questions where 1 equaled extremely dissatisfied and 5 equaled 
extremely satisfied. Means, standard deviation, and skewness were calculated. According to the analysis, 
most participants were satisfied with their experiences with local government (μ= 3.04), satisfied with access 
to public services (μ= 3.57), dissatisfied with community resources for LGBTQIA+ individuals (μ= 2.86), slightly 
dissatisfied when it comes to safety for the LGBTQIA+ community (μ= 2.99), dissatisfied with support for 
LGBTQIA+ families (μ= 2.9), and dissatisfied when it comes to interactions with police (μ= 2.91).

When the responses of transgender participants were considered, the results were more negative in all 
categorized. 

Participants were asked to reflect on their perception of the level of support in their community in a number 
of areas where one equaled strongly disagree and five equaled strongly agree. Respondents disagreed that 
there is adequate support for LGBTQIA+ people on the Shore (μ= 2.72),  for parents of LGBTQIA+ children (μ= 
2.56), for LGBTQIA+ elders (μ= 2.41), for transgender people (μ= 2.11), specifically for transgender youth (μ= 
2.05), and when medical care for transgender adults is considered (μ= 2.12).

When the responses of transgender participants were considered, the results did not differ significantly. 

Participants were asked whether in their opinion, schools in the community are safe for LGBTQIA+ youth and 
only 13% responded in the affirmative with 57% responding that schools are not safe and 29% responding 
that they do not know. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When the responses of transgender participants were isolated, it was abundantly clear that they have a more 
negative outlook when it comes to the safety of LGBTQIA+ students in schools with only 6% of respondents 
answering that LGBTQIA+ youth are safe in our schools. 

Participants were asked to consider their satisfaction with respect to a range of health care services with one 
representing extremely unsatisfied and five representing extremely satisfied. According to the findings, 
participants were dissatisfied with their access to healthcare (μ= 2.98),  mental health treatment (μ= 2.64),  
reproductive care (μ= 2.58), gender affirming care (μ= 2.36),  and geriatric care (μ= 2.97). Respondents were 
satisfied with substance abuse services (μ= 3.05),  health screenings (μ= 3.21),  pediatric care (μ= 3.21),  and 
emergency health services (μ= 3.03),

I had a very hard time finding a provider who would prescribe HRT to me. It took me over a year. 

Severe lack of education and knowledge. I have to go to DE for trans inclusive endocrinology, despite 
Worcester having a huge number of health care providers. Lack of medical care is a big reason I'm moving. 

Far too few providers with long waits or closed practices. Most are not LGBTQIA+ affirming and are clearly not 
trained in serving diverse populations. 

It is almost impossible to find local gender affirming care for a child. We drive across the bridge and it's a huge 
burden. 

It takes a long time to get appointments for any doctor, especially when establishing as a new patient.  Mental 
health services are especially difficult to access as there are not enough providers.  You cannot "shop around" 
to find the best fit for counselors or doctors, but generally take whomever is available. 

Not enough Dr’s, lack of expertise and serious issues you need to go to larger cities for medical care. 

Because of the amount of people moving to the area it is often hard to schedule medical appointments in a 
timely fashion. specifically, obgyns, I have not had a good experience with anyone in the area and it has been 
extremely hard to find someone taking new patients who also takes my insurance. at my last obgyn in 
Wicomico county I was repeatedly asked to take pregnancy tests and then charged for them even though I 
specified every appointment that I am married to a woman, and there is absolutely no chance I am pregnant. I 
think providers in the area need to be more knowledgeable about how to interact with the LGBT community 

I cannot find any LGBTQ+ friendly mental health care or OB/GYNs in my area, so I am going without those 
resources. Specifically, I asked the office where I was applying for a therapist through if there was anybody 
there familiar or comfortable with LGBTQ+ issues, and they told me no, and to look somewhere else.

Sample Responses 

The shore needs support for youth in schools and parents as well as mental health for both sides of the same 
equation. 

Our local PFLAG organization is wonderful. But they can only do so much. They need additional resources. 

More trans gender affirming options for trans people, especially on the Eastern Shore (most are in or around 
Baltimore-which makes it difficult for some people to travel that far) 

More lesbian events. More open discussions. More lesbian sex health topics and meetings. 

More education and working toward openness and understanding of LGBTQIA+ community. 

More specialists and providers of all kinds. A guide would be helpful. 

I think we need more clear-cut access to gender affirming care. Resources are so hard to find. Especially for 
those on Medicare and Medicaid. I'm struggling with finding resources for myself. 

We need funding to support organizations like PFLAG Salisbury so that they can operate a community center 
and hire staff 

More public-school support in all grades. Good, affordable medical and mental health care locally. 

Mental health services, shelter, transgender support, and school support for middle and high school LGBTQ+ 
students. 

LGBTQ+ friendly general practitioner list. I've put off getting regular screening and checkups from fear of 
finding a friendly doctor. And mental health is generally a problem for  all specially under 30 who grew up in a 
time where they can never turn off social interactions. 

The City of Salisbury has a human rights council that is largely invisible and which seems to have no interest in 
the LGBTQ+ community. They do not come to Salisbury Pride, nor is anyone in PFLAG leadership (and the 
people best positioned to speak for the community) on the council. We need a dedicated LGBTQ+ commission. 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
More community get togethers for LGBTQIA people, a dedicated place for us. 

More advocacy for LGBTQIA families and people 

Please provide a program for people to receive “prep” medication free of charge.  There also needs to be more 
locations that offer this service in the Salisbury area. 

A basic understanding of gender nonconforming folks and their needs.  Community space for LGBT+ people of 
all ages.   

PFLAG Salisbury is a chapter of PFLAG, the first and largest national organization dedicated 
to  supporting,  educating,  and  advocating  for  Lesbian,  Gay,  Bisexual,  Transgender, 
Questioning/Queer, plus (LGBTQ+) people and their families. As an organization that leads 
with love serving as ambassadors of hope and inclusivity, PFLAG Salisbury envisions a world 
where  diversity  is  celebrated,  and  all  people  are  respected,  valued,  and  affirmed,  all-
embracing of their sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression.
