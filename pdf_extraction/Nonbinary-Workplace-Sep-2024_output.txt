EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report examines experiences of employment discrimination and harassment against nonbinary 

adults using a survey of 1,902 LGBTQ adults in the workforce, including 163 nonbinary adults, 

conducted in the summer of 2023. We compare the experiences of nonbinary employees with those 

of cisgender LGBQ employees and transgender employees who do not identify as nonbinary.

The majority of nonbinary adults in the workforce are under age 35 (87%), and half (51%) are people 
of color. About three-quarters (74%) of nonbinary people in the workforce are making less than 

$50,000 a year.

Our analysis indicates that employment discrimination against nonbinary employees is persistent 
and widespread. At some point in their lives, about six in 10 nonbinary employees (59%) reported 
experiencing discrimination or harassment at work (including being fired, not hired, not promoted, or 

verbally, physically, or sexually harassed) because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Many nonbinary employees reported recent experiences of discrimination and harassment. Within 

the past year, 16% of nonbinary employees reported that they had been fired, not hired, or not 

promoted because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and 20% reported experiencing 

harassment at work. One in four (26%) nonbinary employees reported experiencing adverse 

treatment because of their LGBTQ status at their current job.

Many nonbinary employees also reported engaging in actions to avoid discrimination and harassment, 

including hiding their nonbinary identity and changing their appearance or behaviors. Nearly half (45%) 

of nonbinary employees were not out to their current supervisor, and 17% were not out to any of their 

co-workers. Two-thirds (67%) of nonbinary employees reported downplaying their LGBTQ status at work 

by doing one or more of the following: changing their speech, mannerisms, appearance, or how they 

dress at work; avoiding work social events; or not talking about their outside activities at work.

Nearly six in 10 (58%) nonbinary employees have looked for another job because of how they were 

treated based on their sexual orientation or gender identity at work, and half (50%) reported leaving a 

job because of such treatment.

Along many measures of adverse workplace experiences, nonbinary employees fall in between 

cisgender LGBQ employees and transgender employees who do not identify as nonbinary, with 

cisgender LGBQ employees reporting the lowest rates of adverse experiences and transgender 

employees reporting the highest. In many cases, nonbinary employees’ reports of adverse workplace 

experiences were closer to the higher levels reported by transgender employees. While the report’s 

key findings are summarized below, the full report includes quotes from respondents to provide 

more detail about their experiences of discrimination and harassment in the workplace.

KEY FINDINGS

Demographics

•  An estimated 87% of nonbinary adults in the workforce are under the age of 35, compared to 

51% of cisgender LGBQ adults and 71% of transgender adults in the workforce.

•  About half (51%) of nonbinary adults in the workforce are people of color.

•  Over 58% of nonbinary adults in the workforce identified as bisexual, 21% selected 

“something else,” and 4% selected “not sure” to describe their sexual orientation.

•  Almost three-quarters are making less than $50,000 a year (74%), compared to less than half 

(48%) of cisgender LGBQ adults in the workforce.

Lifetime Experiences of Discrimination and Harassment

•  At some point in their lives, about six in 10 nonbinary employees (59%) reported experiencing 

discrimination or harassment at work, including being fired, not hired, not promoted, or 

verbally, sexually, or physically harassed because of their gender identity.

 { Discrimination: Forty-five percent of nonbinary employees reported experiencing at least 
one form of employment discrimination (being fired, not hired, not promoted, or being 

denied other workplace opportunities) because of their sexual orientation or gender 

identity at some point in their lives.

 ◆ About one in four nonbinary employees reported being fired (23%) and/or not hired 

(28%) because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

 ◆ Nonbinary employees also described other types of unfair treatment based on their 

sexual orientation and gender identity. Some of these experiences included having 

their shifts changed or their hours reduced, being isolated from other employees or 

customers, and being excluded from company events.

 { Harassment: Half of nonbinary employees (50%) reported experiencing at least one form 
of harassment (verbal, physical, or sexual) at work because of their sexual orientation or 

gender identity at some point in their lives.

 ◆

Forty percent of nonbinary employees reported experiencing verbal harassment from 

supervisors or co-workers because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Many 

nonbinary respondents cited examples of being persistently misgendered, deadnamed, 

or harassed for not conforming to traditional binary genders or gender stereotypes.

 ◆ About one in five (21%) nonbinary employees reported experiencing physical 

harassment at work because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Reports 

of physical harassment included being “threatened,” “cornered,” “roughhoused,” 

“assaulted,” “attacked,” and “strangled.”

 ◆ Close to one-third (31%) of nonbinary employees reported experiencing sexual 

harassment at work because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.

Intersectional Discrimination and Harassment

•  When asked to describe their worst experiences of discrimination and harassment based on 

sexual orientation and gender identity, many nonbinary employees described intersectional 

discrimination based on their multiple marginalized identities. Most frequently, in addition to 

discrimination based on their gender identity, they described discrimination related to being 

bisexual or based on living with a disability.

Recent Experiences of Discrimination and Harassment

•  Discrimination: About one in three nonbinary employees (35%) reported experiencing at least 
one form of employment discrimination (including being fired, not hired, or being denied a 

promotion or other workplace opportunities) based on their sexual orientation or gender 

identity within the past five years. One in six (16%) reported these experiences in the past year.

•  Harassment: Four out of ten nonbinary employees (39%) reported experiencing at least one 

form of harassment (including verbal, physical, or sexual harassment) in the workplace based 

on their sexual orientation or gender identity within in the past five years and one in five 

reported (20%) reported these experiences in the past year.

•  Negative comments: In the past year, about half of nonbinary employees (49%) reported 

hearing negative comments about LGBTQ people in the workplace.

Experiences at Current Job

•  Respondents were asked specifically about their experiences at their current job. About 

two-thirds of nonbinary employees (64%) felt that their current workplace environment was 

somewhat or very supportive of LGBTQ employees. In comparison, approximately one in ten 

(13%) felt their workplace environment was somewhat or very unsupportive.

•  Approximately one in five nonbinary employees (20%) reported one or more adverse 

workplace experiences related to their sexual orientation or gender identity at their current 

job, including 18% who reported unfair treatment, 11% who reported verbal harassment, 7% 

who felt they had not been promoted or were denied other opportunities in the workplace, 

6% who reported sexual harassment, and 1% who reported physical harassment.

Out at Work

•  Forty-five percent of nonbinary employees reported that they are not open about being 

nonbinary to their current supervisor, and approximately one in six (17%) reported that they 

are not out to any of their co-workers. Only one-third (33%) of nonbinary employees reported 

being out to all their co-workers.

Workplace Experiences of Nonbinary Employees   |   5

Covering

•  Two-thirds of nonbinary employees (67%) reported engaging in covering behaviors at their 
current jobs to avoid harassment or discrimination related to their sexual orientation or 

gender identity. About one-third reported changing how they dressed (35%), their physical 

appearance (35%), or their voice or mannerisms (36%) at work. Approximately one in five 

(20%) have changed where, when, or how frequently they used the bathroom.

•  Many nonbinary employees have also avoided work events or work-related travel (25%) and 

work-related social events (39%) to avoid discrimination and harassment.

•  Many nonbinary employees also avoid talking about their families at work to avoid discrimination 

and harassment. Twenty-nine percent of nonbinary employees have avoided talking about 

their family at work, 24% have not brought family to work events, and 21% have not displayed 

photos of their partner or family at work to avoid discrimination and harassment.

Retention

•  About two-thirds of nonbinary employees (68%) were very or somewhat satisfied with their 

current job, while almost one in six (17%) were very or somewhat dissatisfied with their 

current job.

•  Half (50%) of nonbinary employees reported that they had left a job at some point in their 

lives because of how their employer treated them based on their LGBTQ status. About six in 

ten nonbinary employees said that they have looked for other jobs because of how they were 

personally treated by their employer based on their LGBTQ status (58%) or had looked for 

another job because the workplace environment was not supportive of LGBTQ people (60%).

•  Due to the workplace environment for LGBTQ people at their current job, one in five 

nonbinary employees (20%) had considered leaving. Almost two-thirds (65%) of them had 
taken steps towards finding another job.

•  Nonbinary employees were more likely than cisgender LGBQ employees to have left a job 

(50% vs. 31%) or looked for another job (58% vs. 32%) because of how they were treated 

because of their LGBTQ status. Compared to cisgender LGBQ employees, they were also more 

likely to report they had looked for another job due to the general workplace environment for 

LGBTQ employees (60% vs. 36%).

INTRODUCTION

Prior Williams Institute research has estimated that there are approximately 1.2 million LGBTQ adults 
who identify as nonbinary in the United States.1 Nonbinary employees are a growing part of the 
workforce, particularly among younger employees just entering the workforce.2

Prior Williams Institute research indicates as a population, nonbinary LGBTQ adults are young—76% 
are between the ages of 18 and 29—urban, and racially and ethnically diverse.3 Almost half of 
nonbinary LGBTQ adults have a high school degree or less (48%), over 43% are living with low 

incomes (below 200% of the federal poverty level), and almost two-thirds report not having enough 
money to meet their basic needs, including 11% who are unstably housed.4

In terms of employment, prior Williams Institute research found that almost nine in ten nonbinary 

LGBTQ adults are in the workforce (89%), including 52% who are employed full-time, 21% who are 

employed part-time but want a full-time job, 8% who are employed part-time but do not want a full-
time job, and 7% who are unemployed but looking for work.5 The 2015 United States Transgender 
Survey further found that a number of nonbinary people have served in the military: 9% of nonbinary 

respondents overall and 22% of nonbinary respondents with male assigned on their original birth 
certificates have served in the military.6

PRIOR RESEARCH ON WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION AND 
HARASSMENT AGAINST NONBINARY EMPLOYEES

Although there have been a number of studies focused on the workplace experiences of transgender 
and gender-nonconforming people in the United States,7 which may include nonbinary people,8 there 
have been fewer studies specifically focusing on the workplace experiences of nonbinary people.

1 People might identify as “nonbinary” because they identify as having no gender, a gender other than male or female, as having 

more than one gender, or for other reasons. See Jessica A. Clarke, They, Them, Theirs, 132 Harv. L. Rev. 894, 905 (2019) (“Nonbinary 

people may have any number of relationships to gender, including, to name a few, hybridity, rejection, dynamism, insistence on a 

third option, subversion, or all of these.”)

Emerging research explicitly focused on nonbinary people has found that they experience high rates 

of employment discrimination, often engage in covering behaviors at work, are more likely to be 

unemployed than the general population, and are concentrated in low-paying jobs.

A few studies have documented the prevalence of employment discrimination and bias against 

nonbinary employees. For example, a 2023 survey of 454 nonbinary people and 1,483 men and 

women found that 64% of nonbinary people had experienced employment discrimination based on 
gender at some point in their lives, with 7% reporting that these experiences occurred frequently.9 
Women reported experiencing workplace discrimination based on gender at similar rates to 
nonbinary employees, while men reported significantly lower rates of discrimination.10

Another study conducted in 2023 documented employment discrimination against nonbinary 
employees through a survey of 409 nonbinary people and a matched pairs resume test.11 More than 
80% of nonbinary respondents (83%) felt that identifying as nonbinary would hurt their job search. 

About half (51%) of respondents reported having negative workplace experiences related to their 

nonbinary identity. In the matched pairs test, researchers found that resumes including they/them 

pronouns under the applicants’ names received 8% less interest from employers than resumes that did 

not include pronouns. When researchers followed up with hiring managers to ask how the resumes 

could be improved, several expressed explicit bias against nonbinary people. For example, one hiring 

manager stated, “’I would immediately balk at the supposed “gender neutral” pronoun of ‘they/them.’”

A 2020 vignette study, which asked people to rate a fictitious co-worker’s likeability and perceived 

workplace performance based on a short narrative, found that participants rated nonbinary 
employees the lowest, followed by transgender women, with cisgender men rated the highest.12

Studies have found that nonbinary employees often engage in covering behaviors to minimize their 

gender identity in the workplace and mitigate discrimination. For example, a 2024 study based on 

data from the 2015 U.S. Transgender Survey found that nonbinary employees engaged in several 
types of behaviors to cover and avoid discrimination at work.13 The study found that 82% of nonbinary 
respondents reported engaging in self-protective behaviors at work, including hiding or delaying 

their transition or gender identity, not requesting the use of proper pronouns, and staying in a job 
for which they were overqualified. The study also found that only 28% of nonbinary respondents 

who had been discriminated against took redressive actions, including contacting a lawyer or 

administrative agency that handles discrimination complaints. The study found that nonbinary 

employees and transgender women were more likely to engage in self-protective behaviors than 

transgender men.

Research has also documented higher rates of unemployment among nonbinary employees 

and higher concentrations of nonbinary employees in lower-paying jobs. For example, a study 

published in 2016 used data from the 2010 National Transgender Discrimination Survey to evaluate 
employment outcomes of nonbinary people compared to transgender men and women.14 The 
analysis found that among nonbinary adults, 13% were unemployed (compared to 11% of the general 

population at the time of data collection), and 44% had experienced underemployment. The study 

also found that 19% of nonbinary adults had lost a job, and 21% had been denied a promotion. 

Nonbinary employees had similar employment outcomes to transgender men, while transgender 

women were more likely to experience some types of negative workplace experiences. The analysis 

also found that nonbinary employees of color were more likely to experience some types of adverse 

employment outcomes than white nonbinary employees.

In addition, a study using 2020 data from the California Civil Rights Department (CRD) showed that 

nonbinary employees were concentrated in the lowest-paying jobs as laborers, sales employees, 
and service employees, with fewer Black and Latino nonbinary employees in high-paying jobs.15 CRD 
was the first state or federal agency to systematically collect comprehensive quantitative data on 
nonbinary employees’ employment, compensation, and job placement.16

Finally, a Williams Institute study published in 2021 based on data from the Generations and 

TransPop studies (2016-2018) found that 11.3% of nonbinary adults were currently unemployed, 

and 38% had been unemployed and looking for a job for more than a month at least once in their 
lives.17 The study also found that 43% of nonbinary LGBTQ adults reported being fired from a job for 
any reason, 29% reported being denied a promotion or receiving a negative job evaluation, and 40% 

reported having trouble with a boss or co-worker.

Research more broadly focused on transgender and gender-nonconforming employees has also 

documented high rates of adverse employment experiences. For example, a 2022 global survey of 

2,230 transgender and gender-nonconforming employees found that 44% of the U.S. respondents 
reported being victims of sexual harassment or misconduct at work.18 Similarly, a survey of 2,765 
employees across the state of New York, of which 66 respondents identified as transgender, 

nonbinary, nonconforming, or other gender identities, found that half of the respondents who were 
gender minorities reported workplace sexual harassment.19 Another study reviewing 58 empirical 
studies on the workplace experiences of transgender and gender-diverse employees indicated

experiences expose transgender and gender-diverse employees to various stressors that negatively 
impact work outcomes and mental health.20

LEGAL PROTECTIONS FROM DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT 
AGAINST NONBINARY EMPLOYEES

No federal or state civil rights statutes expressly prohibit employment discrimination based on 

nonbinary identity, and little case law addresses the application of existing nondiscrimination laws to 

nonbinary employees. However, nonbinary employees are likely protected, at least to a certain extent, 

from discrimination and harassment related to their nonbinary identity under laws that prohibit 

discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.

Two U.S. Supreme Court cases indicate that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act protects nonbinary 
employees from discrimination and harassment based on their nonbinary identity. In 1989, the 
Supreme Court held in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that discrimination against employees for non-
conformance with stereotypes associated with their biological sex violates Title VII’s ban on sex 
discrimination.21 In the years following the decision, several lower courts held that discrimination 
against transgender employees violates Title VII because such discrimination is rooted in sex 
stereotypes.22 Similarly, discrimination against nonbinary employees based on non-conformance with 
their sex assigned at birth would likely violate Title VII. As explained by one legal scholar, “Requiring 

[a nonbinary employee] to present as either a man or a woman is to require them to conform to sex 
stereotypes.”23

In 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court expressly held in Bostock v. Clayton County that employment 
discrimination against employees based on their homosexual or transgender status violates Title VII 
because such discrimination necessarily entails discrimination based on sex.24 Although the Court 
was considering discrimination against the gay and transgender plaintiffs, the holding likely protects 

all LGBTQ employees, including nonbinary employees, from discrimination based on their LGBTQ 
status. As one employment law scholar explained, the “straightforward analysis in Bostock—that

VII prohibits discrimination against transgender employees based on gender stereotypes, and that employment discrimination 

for gender-nonconforming behavior violates Title VII irrespective of the cause of the behavior); Glenn v. Brumby, 663 F.3d 1312 

(11th Cir. 2011) (in which the court concluded that an employer discriminated against a transgender woman who brought an 

employment discrimination case relying on Price Waterhouse and other Title VII precedent; the court reasoned that a person is 

considered transgender “precisely because of the perception that his or her behavior transgresses gender stereotypes.”); for more,

to discriminate against someone for being labeled one sex at birth but now identifying as another 

unavoidably takes sex into account—applies with equal force to nonbinary people as it does to 

transgender men and women” because “its analysis leaves no coherent way to exclude nonbinary 

people from protections against sex discrimination … A person is understood as nonbinary by virtue 
of sex-based characteristics.”25

Several lower courts have interpreted Title VII and the Supreme Court’s reasoning in Bostock to 
prohibit discrimination against nonbinary employees. For example, a federal district court in 

Wisconsin held that a nonbinary employee could bring a case under Title VII for discrimination based 

on transgender status after introducing the plaintiff as “a person who, in the language of the gender 

identity movement, identifies as nonbinary, more commonly known as transgender, as well as 
intersexual and bisexual.”26 Similarly, a federal district court in Pennsylvania held that discrimination 
against nonbinary employees on the basis of gender and sexual orientation can constitute prohibited 
discrimination based on sex under Title VII.27 One court, a district court in Florida, has further held 
that Title VII likely prohibits employers from requiring nonbinary (and transgender) employees to use 
pronouns that correspond to their sex assigned at birth.28 As the court explained, the pronoun policy 
“discriminates on the basis of sex…because ‘[t]o know which pronouns [the policy] demands [the 
nonbinary] employee use, one must know [the employee’s] sex.’”29

However, other courts have held that there are limits to how far Title VII and the Bostock decision 
reach, particularly concerning issues such as pronoun use, restroom use, and dress codes in the 

workplace. These rulings may limit the extent to which nonbinary employees are protected under 

Title VII from discrimination based on the ways they express their gender at work.

Two cases have arisen as challenges brought by state employers to a technical assistance document 

issued by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 2021. The guidance states 

that “Title VII applies nationwide and protects employees from discrimination based on sexual 

orientation or gender identity” and specifies examples of protected access to gender-affirming 

dress codes, bathrooms, and pronouns in order “to provide clarity to the public regarding existing 
requirements under the [Title VII] law” post-Bostock.30 Two courts have struck down the EEOC 
guidance document. Both courts held that the guidance document was invalid on various grounds 
because it sought to prohibit conduct beyond the scope of Title VII and Bostock. In the words of 

25 See, e.g., Merrick T. Rossein, Title VII and Employees with Nonbinary Identity, in Employment Discrimination Law And 

Litigation § 27:13 (2020).

26 See, e.g. Lammers v. Pathways to a Better Life, LLC, No. 1:18-cv-01579 (E.D. Wis. Jul. 19, 2021) (order denying motion for 

summary judgment because it was undisputed that the nonbinary transgender plaintiff was a member of a protected class and 

they had proffered sufficient evidence defendants had fired them because of their transgender and/or nonbinary status).

27 Rodriguez v. Northeast Community Center for Behavioral Health, No. 2:23-cv-03753 (E.D. Penn. March 14, 2024) (order denying 

the employer’s motion to dismiss the employee’s Title VII claim).

United States of America’s Statement of Interest[.]”).

the district court in Texas that heard one of the cases, Bostock established that “Title VII prohibits 
employment discrimination against an individual ‘for being homosexual,’ ‘for being transgender’…
not necessarily all correlated conduct….The [guidance] misread[s] Bostock by melding ‘status’ and 
‘conduct’ into one catchall protected class covering all conduct correlating to ‘sexual orientation’ and 
‘gender identity.’”31 In response to these rulings, the EEOC released a new version of its 2021 guidance 
document in 2024, but it has also been challenged in court.32 These cases indicate that some courts 
may be unwilling to find that Title VII prohibits all forms of discrimination and mistreatment against 

nonbinary people in the workplace, in particular, instances of incorrect pronoun use, requiring that 

employees use restrooms that align with their sex assigned at birth, and enforcing dress codes based 

on sex assigned at birth.

Many state civil rights statutes would likely also be interpreted to protect nonbinary people from 

employment discrimination to at least some extent. Twenty-three states and D.C. have laws that 
expressly prohibit discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation.33 Many of 
these states also specifically prohibit discrimination based on “gender expression.”34 These laws 
generally define “gender identity” broadly; protections are not limited to employees who identify as 

“transgender.” For example, the Massachusetts law prohibits employment discrimination “because 
of … gender identity, sexual orientation,”35 and the Nevada law prohibits employment discrimination 
“because of … sexual orientation, gender identity or expression.”36 In ten additional states, state 
statutes that prohibit discrimination based on sex have been interpreted to prohibit discrimination 
based on gender identity and sexual orientation consistent with the Court’s decision in Bostock.37 

31 Texas v. EEOC, No. 2:21-cv-00194 (N.D. Tex. Oct. 1, 2022) (order vacating the 2021 Guidance on a nationwide basis).

32 Though the court dismissed the state’s challenge, it did not reach the substantive issues raised. Rather, the court simply said 

that the state must file a new complaint rather than asserting that the EEOC contradicted the court’s previous order against the 

2021 guidance when it issued a new guidance document in 2024. Thus, it is likely that the plaintiffs will file a new complaint 

seeking to invalidate the 2024 guidance. Texas v. EEOC, No. 2:21-cv-00194 (N.D. Tex. Jul. 17, 2024) (order denying plaintiffs’ motion

These laws would likely also protect employees from discrimination based on their nonbinary identity, 

at least to the same extent as Title VII.

At least one state human rights commission has indicated that nonbinary employees are protected 

from discrimination under state law in a case that addressed gendered dress codes. The Washington 

State Commission on Human Rights found that an employer violated the state’s gender identity 

nondiscrimination law when it enforced a gender-based dress code for flight attendants against a 
genderfluid employee.38 The policy required flight attendants to choose the appropriate “masculine” 
or “feminine” uniform based on their gender.39 The Washington State Commission on Human Rights 
found that the dress code forced the genderfluid flight attendant “to try fitting into a binary uniform 

system despite identifying as neither male nor female,” which constituted discrimination based 
on gender identity and expression.40 Genderfluid and nonbinary individuals, both being gender-
nonconforming in their gender identity, are likely similarly situated in terms of nondiscrimination laws 

protecting against discrimination based on gender identity.

Together, these state and federal laws likely protect nonbinary employees from discrimination and 

harassment based on their nonbinary status. The laws may also protect nonbinary employees from 

discrimination related to pronoun use and other conduct issues that may arise in the workplace.

DEMOGRAPHICS

One hundred and sixty-three (163) nonbinary adults in the workforce responded to our survey of 

LGBTQ employees conducted In July 2023. Nonbinary employees are young: 87% were under the age 

of 35, and almost all (97%) were under the age of 45. Nonbinary employees were more likely to be 

under the age of 35 than cisgender LGBQ (51%) and transgender (71%) employees.

About half of nonbinary employees (51%) identified as people of color, including 9% who identified as 
Black and 27% who identified as Latinx.41 Nonbinary employees (10%) were more likely to identify as 
being of an “other race” (besides White, Latinx, Black, or Asian) than cisgender LGBQ employees (4%).

Workplace Experiences of Nonbinary Employees   |   14

In terms of sexual orientation, most nonbinary employees identified as bisexual (58%), something else 

(21%), or “not sure” (4%). Less than 16% identified as gay, lesbian, or straight.

About half of nonbinary employees were single (53%), and almost half were living with a partner 

(47%). Approximately half of those living with a partner identified their partner as male (49%), a 

quarter identified their partner as female (24%), and just over a quarter identified their partner as 

transgender (13%) or nonbinary (13%). Nonbinary employees (14%) were less likely to be married 

than cisgender LGBQ (27%) and transgender (29%) employees.

About six in 10 nonbinary employees did not have a bachelor’s degree (62%), and almost three-

quarters were making less than $50,000 a year (74%), with 34% making less than $24,000 a year. Only 

8% are making $100,000 or more a year.

Likely because they are younger, nonbinary employees were less likely to have a postgraduate degree 

than cisgender LGBQ employees (8% v.16%). Further, while half of cisgender LGBQ employees (52%) 

reported annual incomes over $50,000, only one in four nonbinary employees reported incomes at 

this level (26%).

Almost all nonbinary respondents were currently working (97%), with about two-thirds (65%) 

working in the private sector. Nine percent worked in the non-profit sector, and 9% worked for the 

government or military.

FINDINGS

LIFETIME EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT

Employment discrimination against nonbinary employees is persistent and widespread. At some 
point in their lives, about six in 10 nonbinary employees (59%) reported experiencing discrimination 
or harassment at work, including being fired, not hired, not promoted, or verbally, physically, or 

sexually harassed because of their gender identity. Nonbinary employees were more likely to report 

these experiences than cisgender LGBQ employees (45%) and less likely to report these experiences 

than transgender employees (82%).

Half of nonbinary employees (49%) reported that they had been treated unfairly at work because of 

their gender identity or sexual orientation at some point in their careers. This was higher than the 

percentage of cisgender LGBQ employees (33%) who reported unfair treatment at work. Similarly, 

more nonbinary employees (83%) had heard negative comments about LGBTQ people in the 

workplace than cisgender LGBQ employees (71%). Nonbinary employees were about as likely to hear 

negative comments as transgender employees (85%).

Discrimination

Forty-five percent of nonbinary employees reported experiencing at least one form of employment 

discrimination (being fired, not hired, not promoted, or being denied other workplace opportunities) 

because of their sexual orientation or gender identity at some point in their lives. Nonbinary 

employees were more likely to report such experiences than cisgender LGBQ employees (31%) but 

less likely than transgender employees (70%).

More specifically, about one in four nonbinary employees reported being fired (23%) or not hired 

(28%) because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Twenty-nine percent of nonbinary 

employees reported not being promoted or having been denied other opportunities at work because 

of their LGBTQ status. While similar percentages of nonbinary and LGBQ cisgender employees 

reported each of these types of discrimination, nonbinary employees were less likely to report these 

types of discrimination than transgender employees.

Respondents to the survey were asked about their more recent experiences of discrimination or 

harassment. Reports of discrimination by nonbinary employees include:

A boss told me that I either had to "toughen up and stop acting like a 'tranny twink'" or 

leave. I quit on the spot.

— Black nonbinary employee from Pennsylvania

I was working at a veterinary clinic and was always treated unfairly and poorly by the 

doctors because I was more masculine presenting than all of the other females who worked 

at the clinic. I always worked hard and showed up and wanted to learn new things, but they 

would always try to teach and promote prettier, more feminine-looking girls even though I 

had more experience and was more reliable.

— White nonbinary employee from Tennessee

Oftentimes, I was passed up for a promotion because I wasn’t “manly” enough, and they 

doubted my ability to lead a team

— Latinx nonbinary employee from California

I worked somewhere for five years without a raise or promotion because I am female and 

genderfluid.

— White nonbinary employee from Alabama

Workplace Experiences of Nonbinary Employees   |   18

A manager denied me a promotion (I am a nonbinary feminine-presenting person) in favor 

of a man with two fewer years of experience. The same manager would also touch me 

inappropriately during work hours and make suggestive comments about my clothing.

— White nonbinary employee from Colorado

[I was] passed over for projects and promotions because of my non-heteronormative family life.
— Nonbinary employee of color from Washington

Some nonbinary employees also mentioned being isolated from co-workers, sometimes by their 

supervisor through scheduling changes and shift assignments:

Because I have body hair, which makes me look more masculine, no one wanted to talk to 

me or work together.

 — Nonbinary employee of color from Florida

Many of my co-workers and managers would call me slurs and exclude me from work and 

social activities because I’m nonbinary.

— White nonbinary employee from Minnesota

I was forced to work alone doing hard manual labor because co-workers joked, “It will 

toughen this girly boy up.”

 — Nonbinary employee of color from Washington

At a fast-food chain, I was scheduled less hours than everyone else, and my general 

manager told me it was because I made my co-workers uncomfortable since they knew I 

was nonbinary.

— White nonbinary employee from Idaho

Nonbinary employees also reported that sometimes the preferences of customers were given as a 
reason for excluding them from opportunities at work:

I was ... denied an opportunity to work on a big project allegedly because a client was 

uncomfortable with the way I looked.

— White nonbinary employee from Idaho

I wouldn’t be allowed to do catering events because of how I presented myself and my 

gender expression.

Harassment

Half of nonbinary employees (50%) reported experiencing at least one form of harassment (verbal, 

physical, or sexual harassment) at work at some point in their lives because of their sexual orientation 

or gender identity. Nonbinary employees were more likely to report workplace harassment than 

cisgender LGBQ employees (35%) but less likely to report harassment of transgender employees (68%).

Forty percent of nonbinary employees reported experiencing verbal harassment because of their 

sexual orientation or gender identity, more than the 28% of cisgender LGBQ employees who reported 

verbal harassment, but less than the 65% of transgender employees who reported such harassment. 

Reports of verbal harassment include:

I overheard my manager talking disparagingly about me to the rest of my bosses because 

of my gender expression.

— Black nonbinary employee from Connecticut

I used to work at a supermarket around my neighborhood, and everything seemed great … 

[un]til the manager started talking about me (the way I looked).

 — Nonbinary employee of color from New York

Many nonbinary respondents cited examples of being persistently misgendered or deadnamed:

I was frequently told not to mention pronouns and frequently misgendered by all my co-

workers because I wasn’t allowed to use pronouns. This was at a defense manufacturing 

company.

— White nonbinary employee from Arizona

Workplace Experiences of Nonbinary Employees   |   20

My boss wasn’t very fond of my preferred pronoun choices and chose to call me by my 

dead name.

— Black nonbinary employee from Virginia

My pronouns are on my nametag but not properly used. I am the only trans/nonbinary 

employee at my location and often feel singled out.

— White nonbinary employee from Connecticut

I was treated like a woman and dead-named and misgendered despite being a masc-

presenting nonbinary person. I had compassion for small mistakes since I was the only 

trans person on the team and took measures like wearing pronoun pins on my lapel, as 

well as putting my pronouns underneath my nametag on my office cube. Unfortunately, it 

was still largely ignored. I felt disrespected and like it wasn’t worth considering.

— White nonbinary employee from California

Nonbinary respondents also described incidents of verbal harassment focused on the ways that they 

did not conform to binary genders or traditional gender norms:

Most people stare and tell me there are only two genders and I need to grow up.

— Black nonbinary employee from California

A co-worker commented on another co-worker’s gender expression, saying she “couldn’t 

pick a gender.”

— White nonbinary employee from Georgia

I was teased for the way I dressed daily and how strong my physique is.

— Black nonbinary employee from Michigan

In some cases, reports of verbal harassment came from customers or clients:

A customer started to harass me, and my boss ended up supporting the customer. I had to 

take the blame for simply being myself.

— Latinx nonbinary employee from California

A customer continuously questioned my gender (e.g., “sir, ma’am, whatever you are”).

— Black nonbinary employee from Washington

[I] was teaching students with conservative families who started making things up [about me], 

saying I was adding things to the curriculum. [The] principal believed them instead of me.

— White nonbinary employee from North Carolina

Once they found out I was bisexual, they [did]n’t want me to work with the older kids.

— Latinx nonbinary employee from Kansas

Workplace Experiences of Nonbinary Employees   |   21

Physical Harassment

About one in five (21%) nonbinary employees reported experiencing physical harassment because 

of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Transgender employees were more likely to report 

physical harassment at work (34%). Reports of physical harassment against nonbinary respondents 

included being “threatened,” “cornered,” “roughhoused,” “assaulted,” “attacked,” and “strangled”:

I was drummed out of my last job by my homophobic boss, who cornered me in the 

breakroom and attacked me. I did report this, and despite having witnesses and prior bad 

acts from that supervisor, nothing was done about the assault.

— White nonbinary employee from Colorado

I had several people talk down to me. I have had them call me names. Throw things at me. 

They told me I was worthless and would amount to nothing in life.

— White nonbinary employee from Iowa

A co-worker strangled me at a counter and said he was trying to “give a girl a massage.”

— Latinx nonbinary employee from Colorado

Sexual Harassment

Thirty-one percent of nonbinary employees reported experiencing sexual harassment at work 

because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Nonbinary employees were more likely to 

report sexual harassment than cisgender LGBQ employees (20%). Reports of sexual harassment from 

nonbinary respondents included:

I was 18 [and had] just started college. I was dressed androgynously for my first day at 

my new job. My boss hit on me … saying, “Hey, I go both ways, so you’re perfect!” I was 

mortified because he even said it in front of two of my co-workers.

 — Nonbinary employee of color from Kansas

I worked in a gym … one time, my manager’s boss came in and pulled me for a one-on-

one training session and said to me during that time, “You naturally have an advantage 

selling, like, oh god, I’m already hard.” From that day forward, I was always incredibly 

uncomfortable in the workplace, and I was continually subjected to this kind of behavior by 

other workers about myself.

— Latinx nonbinary employee from Connecticut

I was constantly sexually harassed by a co-worker who then became very mad and 

aggressive when I did not reciprocate his advances. My supervisor did nothing and the 

manager above [him] did nothing as well.

— White nonbinary employee from Massachusetts

 
 
 
Workplace Experiences of Nonbinary Employees   |   22

I was sexually assaulted by a co-worker. He knew I was disabled, and he had a physical 

advantage over me … Prior to the assault, he cornered me and described in graphic detail 

his wish for a threesome with me … When I reported him and took him to court, I received a 

restraining order. Instead of honoring it, HR brought an attorney into the room and denied 

the order. They said they would change our schedules, so we weren’t working together, and 

that’s the best they could do.

— Latinx nonbinary employee from California

Intersectional Discrimination

A number of nonbinary employees reported incidents of discrimination and harassment related to their 

multiple marginalized identities or intersectional discrimination. “Intersectionality” was originally defined 

by UCLA Law Professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, who used the term to refer to the double discrimination of 

racism and sexism experienced by Black women and as a critique of the “single-axis framework that is 
dominant in anti-discrimination law.”43 Crenshaw defined intersectionality as a tool to understand “the 
ways that multiple forms of inequality or disadvantage sometimes compound themselves and create 
obstacles that often are not understood” by considering one identity in isolation.44

Nonbinary respondents most frequently reported incidents of discrimination and harassment based 

on both their sexual orientation and gender identity. Since most nonbinary respondents identified as 

bisexual, it is not surprising that many nonbinary people described experiences of discrimination and 

harassment focused on their sexual orientation.

Once a co-worker found out I was bisexual, they began to frequently talk about wanting to 

watch me have sex with a woman because they thought it would be “hot.”

— White nonbinary employee from Indiana

Being bisexual at my other job, I was treated differently and put in uncomfortable 

situations or asked very inappropriate questions about my sexual activity.

 — Nonbinary employee of color from Pennsylvania

[My] girlfriend came to my job to bring me lunch. Soon as I came back inside … 

“management”… kept harassing me and using derogatory language … I don’t even want 

to repeat what was said. Just plain nasty and verbal abuse … We were harassed on social 

media, gas stations, even Walmart, anytime someone from work saw us out together.

Notably, several nonbinary respondents reported experiences that included discriminatory treatment 

based on gender identity and disability status:

My employer … would cut my hours, believing my gender and mental disabilities would affect 

the amount of customers we would acquire, giving me times of work with less customers.

— White nonbinary employee from Missouri

I was denied a significant promotion in the disability services office in which I worked due to 

the office’s unjustified views of queer people combined with their low expectations of the quality 

of work that disabled people (especially queer, non-cisgender disabled people) could bring.
— Nonbinary employee of color from California

I was told to not correct people on my pronouns and not to wear any pronoun-related pins 
or stickers because it “made people uncomfortable.” I also had my work tampered with by 

another employee who made comments about my disability and gender.

— White nonbinary employee from Texas

I was yelled at by my boss on multiple occasions for being too feminine, too emotional, 

too liberal, and “not choosing” (a sexuality or a gender). When her verbal assault made me 

cry, she yelled at me to toughen up and further belittled me for having rejection sensitivity, 

autism, and an autoimmune disease.

— Latinx nonbinary employee from Florida

Other nonbinary employees reported experiences at the intersection of the nonbinary status and 

race, ethnicity, or religion:

I was cornered in a freezer, and he yelled slurs at me because I’m nonbinary and I’m with a 

Black man.

— White nonbinary employee from Missouri

My boss berates me for my private relationship with my partner and for being Muslim. He 

yells at me and judges my work … He uses this belief to attack me and other queer people. 

My boss is Christian, and I am Muslim.

RECENT EXPERIENCES OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT

LGBTQ employees continue to experience discrimination even after the U.S. Supreme Court held 
in Bostock v. Clayton County that discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity are 
forms of sex discrimination prohibited by Title VII.45 This decision extended federal nondiscrimination 
protections to LGBTQ employees nationwide as of June 2020.

A clear pattern emerges when examining recent experiences of discrimination and harassment, 

with nonbinary employees approximately twice as likely to report adverse workplace experiences 

as cisgender LGBQ employees but less likely than transgender employees. For example, 29% of 

nonbinary employees reported workplace discrimination or harassment in the past year, compared to 

15% of cisgender LGBQ employees and 47% of transgender employees.

Recent Discrimination

About one-third of nonbinary respondents (35%) reported being fired, not hired, or being denied a 

promotion or other workplace opportunities in the past five years, and one in six (17%) reported such 

experiences in the year prior to taking the survey. By comparison, 9% of cisgender LGBQ employees 

had such experiences in the past year, as did 31% of transgender employees.

In terms of the specific forms of discrimination experienced in the past year, 4% of nonbinary 

employees reported being fired, 10% reported being not hired, and 9% reported not being promoted 

or being denied other workplace opportunities based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. 

Nonbinary employees differed the most from transgender employees in terms of past year experiences, 

with 12% of transgender employees reporting that they had been fired and 20% reporting that they had 

not been hired in the past year due to their sexual orientation or gender identity.

EXPERIENCES AT CURRENT JOB

Respondents were asked specifically about their experiences at their current job. About two-thirds 
of nonbinary employees (64%) felt that their current workplace environment was somewhat or very 
supportive of LGBTQ people. In comparison, eleven percent (13%) felt their workplace environment 

was somewhat or very unsupportive of LGBTQ people. While about two-thirds (68%) of nonbinary 

employees felt somewhat or very satisfied with their current job, 17% were somewhat or very 

dissatisfied with their current job.

At their current job, one in four (26%) nonbinary employees reported one or more adverse workplace 

experiences related to their sexual orientation or gender identity. More specifically, 18% reported 

unfair treatment, 11% reported verbal harassment, 8% felt they had not been promoted or denied 

other opportunities in the workplace, 6% reported sexual harassment, and 1% reported physical 

harassment.

While nonbinary employees reported adverse experiences at their current jobs at similar levels as 

cisgender LGBQ employees, transgender employees reported higher levels of verbal and physical 

harassment.

AVOIDING DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT

LGBTQ employees often take steps to avoid experiencing discrimination and harassment.46 For 
example, LGBTQ employees may conceal their sexual orientation or gender identity at work, avoid 

talking about their personal lives with co-workers, or change their appearance to conform to gender 

norms. Engaging in these behaviors, sometimes referred to as “covering,” can be a source of stress for 
LGBTQ people and negatively impact their health and well-being.47

Forty-five percent of nonbinary employees reported that they are not open about being LGBTQ 

to their current supervisor, and one in six (17%) reported that they are not out to any of their co-

workers. Only one-third (33%) of nonbinary employees reported being out to all their co-workers.

Not being out, in full or in part, is how many respondents protect themselves from discrimination 

and harassment. Prior Williams Institute research has found that LGBT people who are out to at 

least some people in the workplace are approximately three times more likely to have experienced 

discrimination or harassment because of their sexual orientation or gender identity than those who 
are not out to anyone at work.48

Nonbinary employees shared some of the reasons that they are not out at work, including past 

experiences related to being out in the workplace and seeing the harassment that their out-LGBTQ 

co-workers have experienced:

I personally do not experience harassment or discrimination because I present as straight 

and cisgender to cis straight people. I always hide my gender identity and sexuality. No 

one has yet found out or outed me. I used to be open about my pronouns, but I have since 

learned that people never respect them, especially when there are much older people in the 

company, so I have resigned myself to hiding them.

— Asian nonbinary employee from California

I had a lot of co-workers that made my life hell for me just being me. I don’t bring my 

identity or gender or sexual orientation into the workplace since it is not the place for it. 

However, they found out about it and began to treat me differently, harassed me, wouldn’t 

give me work, or dumped everything on me. Got so bad I left.

— Asian nonbinary employee from California

Workplace Experiences of Nonbinary Employees   |   29

I just never felt comfortable telling my workplace I’m nonbinary cause I always hear how 

my co-workers talk behind peoples’ backs about the way others may present themselves 

outside. A lot of people who work in this retail place who present differently never make it 

past the first year hired, and it makes me nervous to be myself.

— Latinx nonbinary employee from Texas

I don’t really discuss my sexuality or gender identity at work much, so I don’t think I 

experience much unfair treatment or harassment … In general, it doesn’t come up, and I 

just experience the ways people’s bigotry comes out around me. One person was bigoted 

towards a new co-worker who was using they/them pronouns, and I was able to experience 

that, but they didn’t know my own thoughts surrounding gender identity.

— White nonbinary employee from Massachusetts

LGBTQ people and others with marginalized identities often adjust their behavior and conduct in 

order to avoid bringing attention to a stigmatized trait—a process that has been called “covering” by 
New York University law professor Kenji Yoshino.49 LGBTQ people who are open about their sexual 
orientation and gender identity may still engage in covering behaviors in order to minimize their 
LGBTQ identity.50

Many nonbinary employees reported engaging in covering behaviors at their current jobs to avoid 

harassment or discrimination related to sexual orientation or gender identity. About two-thirds of 

nonbinary employees (67%) reported that they take steps to change how they present themselves 

at work, including over one-third who reported changing how they dressed (35%), their physical 

appearance (35%), or their voice or mannerisms (36%) at work. One in five (20%) nonbinary 

employees have changed where, when, or how frequently they used the bathroom.

Covering behaviors related to how employees present themselves at work and bathroom use were 

more common for nonbinary employees than cisgender LGBQ employees. Nonbinary employees 

were less likely to report changes in bathroom use than transgender employees, though nonbinary 

employees reported similar levels of changing their appearance as transgender employees.

Many nonbinary employees also reported that they avoided work events and travel (25%) and work-

related social events (39%) in order to avoid discrimination and harassment. Over 42% reported that 

they avoided talking about their social activities outside of work with co-workers in order to avoid 

discrimination and harassment.

Nonbinary employees also reported that they downplayed their families at work to avoid 

discrimination and harassment. About thirty percent of nonbinary employees (29%) have avoided 

talking about their family at work, 24% have not brought family to work events, and 21% have not 

displayed photos of their partner or family at work to avoid discrimination and harassment.

While covering behaviors are often initiated by LGBTQ people to prevent discrimination and 

harassment, some respondents also indicated that they have engaged in these behaviors because 

they were directly told to do so:

I was scolded for not being “ladylike.” I was told that the boss would not like my demeanor 

& appearance. It was implied that I was unsuited to work in that office

— White nonbinary employee from New York

I was verbally assaulted and outcast from a previous job. Not only did HR threaten to fire 

me if I was to ‘keep it up,’ but I was yelled at in front of customers for looking too gay.

— Nonbinary employee of color from Arizona

My worst experience at work was due to me identifying as nonbinary and presenting as 
more masculine even though I am biologically female. I use the family (unisex) restrooms 

so that I feel more comfortable, and the people around me do too. However, it is very 

far away from my office and … makes my … restroom[breaks] longer than they should 

be. My supervisor began to tell me that I needed to hurry up … [My] female co-workers … 

expressed their concern with me using the female restrooms, and that’s why I switched 

to the unisex one. My supervisor also told me that I wouldn’t be allowed to use his guy’s 

restrooms. I didn’t have a choice, but I got in trouble every day, every time I went.

— Black nonbinary employee from North Carolina

IMPACT OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT ON EMPLOYEE 
RETENTION

Discrimination and harassment, or fear of those experiences, negatively affect the well-being of 
employees, which, in turn, can negatively impact employers.51 Decades of research have linked 
unsupportive workplace environments for LGBTQ people to poorer health, decreased job satisfaction, 
and decreased job commitment, among other negative outcomes.52

Half of nonbinary employees (50%) reported that they had left a job at some point in their lives 

because of how their employer treated them based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. 

Fifty-eight percent of nonbinary employees said that they have looked for other jobs because of how 

they were personally treated by their employer based on their LGBTQ status, and 60% had done so 

because the workplace environment, in general, was not supportive of LGBTQ people.

51 See, e.g., M.V. Lee Badgett et al., Williams Inst., The Business Impact of LGBT-Supportive Workplace Policies (2013), https:// 

williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Impact-LGBT-Support-Workplace-May-2013.pdf. These employee outcomes 

can have economic consequences for employers.

Nonbinary employees were more likely to have left a job (50% v. 31%) or looked for another job (58% 

v. 32%) because of how they were treated based on their sexual orientation or gender identity than 

cisgender LGBQ employees. Compared to cisgender LGBQ employees, nonbinary employees were 

also more likely to report they had looked for another job due to the general workplace environment 

for LGBTQ employees (60% v. 36%).

Due to the workplace environment at their current job, one in five nonbinary employees (20%) had 
considered leaving. About two-thirds (65%) of them had taken steps towards finding another job.

Some nonbinary respondents who left their jobs or thought about leaving because of harassment and 

discrimination shared these experiences in their write-in responses. Others wanted to leave but felt 

trapped by their job prospects:

No one knows, but the way they talk about people who aren’t straight makes me sick, and I 

didn’t want to be there.

— Nonbinary employee of color from Alaska

I left a job because the owner stated that gay people should never exist and they should all 

be lined up and gunned down.

— White nonbinary employee from Pennsylvania

I had to leave without notice from a really well-paying job because I was being harassed 

and threatened by a fellow co-worker because of my gender expression and gender 

orientation. I felt threatened [and] had a boss who clearly did not care or understand.

— Latinx nonbinary employee from Texas

[I] had an extremely bigoted and Christian boss at a non-profit … Because of the general 

hostility and snide comments about literally anyone who didn’t act and think exactly as 

they did, I kept my mouth shut most of the time out of fear of being harassed ... During 

June, they would complain about LGBTQIA lifestyles being “shoved down their throats.” Just 

because they saw an extra rainbow or two. Needless to say, I did not make friends with 

them and found another job as soon as I could.

— White nonbinary employee from Arkansas

CONCLUSION

Nonbinary employees face high levels of discrimination and harassment in the workplace. Their 

lifetime experiences of discrimination and harassment are particularly high when considering that 

the vast majority are under the age of 35. In part because of their age, this group of employees earn 

less and are less likely to have a college degree. Many nonbinary employees are not fully out in the 

workplace, and many are actively engaged in “covering” behaviors, such as changing their dress or 

appearance, to hide or downplay their identity. Experiences of discrimination and harassment, as well 

as unsupportive workplace environments, are leading many nonbinary employees to consider leaving 

their current jobs.

The findings in this report suggest that employers must pay specific attention to the workplace 

experiences of nonbinary employees, in particular, to retain younger employees. Policymakers 

should consider issuing explicit guidance stating that federal and state nondiscrimination policies 

that prohibit sex and gender identity discrimination include protections for nonbinary employees. 

Such guidance should specifically address the use of names and pronouns that employees 

request; nonbinary employees’ access to bathrooms, lockers, changing rooms, and showers; sexual 

harassment against nonbinary employees; discrimination through schedule and shift changes; and 

intersectional discrimination.

Finally, the individual reports of discrimination shared by nonbinary employees indicate that further 

research should study the ways in which they face intersectional discrimination, including on the basis 

of sexual orientation and disability, sexual harassment, and the use of schedule and shift changes to 

isolate them from other co-workers, clients, and opportunities for job growth.

APPENDIX

METHODS

The Employment Experiences Survey Wave II was an anonymous cross-sectional survey conducted 

between July 12 and July 21, 2023, with 1,902 LGBTQ adults ages 18 and up who were currently in the 

workforce. Participants were selected by Morning Consult from the Lucid and Pure Spectrum survey 
panels.53 Using screening questions provided by the Williams Institute, panelists were screened on 
sex assigned at birth, gender identity, sexual orientation identity and workforce participation and job 

type to recruit sexual and gender minority participants. In addition, we aimed to survey at least 100 

LGBTQ people in each of the six regions identified in Figure 5 above (response numbers by region 

ranged from 107 in the Rocky Mountain region to 517 in the Southeast). Eligible panelists reviewed an 

information sheet before opting to participate in an online English language survey.

The Employment Experiences Survey Wave II was largely based on the Employment Experiences 
Survey Wave I.54 This survey was developed primarily to gather data about experiences of harassment 
and discrimination among LGBTQ workers. Where possible, survey questions were modeled on 

prior questions used to assess employment discrimination and efforts to avoid discrimination. 

For example, some employment discrimination questions were informed by the Williams Major 
Lifetime Discrimination Scale.55 Some questions about concealment and avoidance are from a survey 
developed by the Center for American Progress.56 Questions about outness at work were informed 
by the 2008 General Social Survey and questions about job commitment were informed by the 
Human Rights Campaign’s 2018 “A Workplace Divided” survey.57 Two open-ended questions were 
also included in the survey to gather information about the participant’s worst experience of unfair 

treatment, harassment, or discrimination at work because of their sexual orientation or gender 

53 Prior to selecting the Lucid and Pure Spectrum panels for this study, and others, Morning Consult examined European Society 

for Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR) documents that contain a uniform set of roughly 30 questions for survey panel 

providers on topics such as sample sources and recruitment, respondent profiling data, respondent privacy and data security, 

data quality and validation, and survey incentives. Non-probability panels are formed by recruiting panelists through loyalty 

and rewards programs, publisher partnerships, advertisements on mobile, tablet and desktop websites, and outreach to online 

gaming communities; snowball sampling or river sampling are excluded. In addition, Morning Consult examines panels for quality 

based on average survey completion time and correlations between dozens of variable pairs known to have high correlations 

(e.g., party identification and political ideology, education and income, country headed in the right direction and leader approval, 

vote and political party, and consumer confidence variables). In general, only panels that meet Morning Consult’s quality 

requirements are approved as sample providers.

identity, as well as experiences where the religious beliefs of others were believed to be a factor in 

how the respondent was treated.

In addition to questions included in the 2021 survey, the 2023 survey included questions about 

intersectional discrimination (discrimination based on multiple marginalized characteristics), co-

workers’ perceptions of respondents’ perceived masculinity and femininity, and employer-level 

policies and practices that support LGBTQ people. The intersectional discrimination questions were 

informed by the Generations Study. The question about perceived masculinity and femininity was 

informed by the recommended measure for assessing gender conformity in the GenIUSS guide to 

Best Practices for Asking Questions to Identify Transgender and Other Gender Minority Respondents 
on Population-Based Surveys.58

A total of 1,902 participants who self-identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender or nonbinary 

(as determined by responses to questions about sex assigned at birth and current gender identity) 

were included in the analytic sample for this report. Participants who selected gender identity 

options that were the same as their sex assigned at birth were classified as cisgender. Participants 

who selected gender identity response options, including male, female, and transgender, which 

differed from their sex assigned at birth, were classified as transgender. Participants who selected the 

nonbinary gender identity response option were classified as nonbinary.

Cisgender participants who reported “something else” as their sexual orientation identity (n=98) were 

excluded from empirical analyses, given uncertainty about whether they were sexual minorities or 

not. Descriptive analyses were conducted using the survey package in R v4.3.2 statistical software 

and included design-based F-tests (Rao-Scott chi-square tests) of differences in proportions to assess 
whether outcomes vary across demographic groups at an alpha of 0.05.59 Confidence intervals (95% 
CI) were included in Appendix tables to communicate the degree of uncertainty around an estimate 

due to sampling error.

All analyses were weighted using sampling weights developed by Morning Consult. To construct 

the sampling weights for the entire sample, Morning Consult used the 2018 Population Assessment 
of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Public Use File.60 The 2018 PATH survey was conducted with a large 
nationally representative sample of U.S. adults and included measures of sexual orientation identity 

and transgender status. The PATH data were subset on LGBTQ respondents in the workforce (full-

time employed, part-time employed, self-employed, or looking for work), and this subset was used to 

establish weighting targets for age (4 categories), sex assigned at birth (2 categories), race/ethnicity 

(5 categories), education (3 categories), and region (6 categories). Iterative proportional fitting (or 

“raking”) was then used to create the weight variable. Weights were trimmed at 6 to avoid over-

weighting a small number of respondents, and they were normalized to sum to the sample size, 

which is common practice.

While selection probabilities for non-probability samples are unknown, in practice, probability panels 
face the same methodological challenges as non-probability panels61 that need to be addressed using 
statistical adjustment. While most non-probability panels are not representative per se, statistical 

adjustments can be used to create unbiased and representative samples independently of the initial 

recruitment process.

The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at UCLA.

The quotes from the respondents in this report were collected through one open-ended question: 

“Tell us about your worst experience of unfair treatment, harassment, or discrimination at work.” 

Responses were selected for inclusion in this report to illustrate certain points while avoiding 

duplication in the content of the quotes and representing the full diversity of the sample in terms of 

sexual orientation, gender identity, sex, race, ethnicity, occupation, and current state of residence. 

The responses were edited to correct for typos, spelling, grammar, missing words, and other issues 

not impacting their substance. Where words were otherwise changed (for verb tense, pronouns, 

clarity, to change information that could be used to identify the respondent, etc.), the changes are 

noted with brackets. Where words were cut (primarily to reduce the length of the quote or cut 

personally identifying information), the omission is marked with ellipses. Names of employers were 

removed and replaced with language describing the type of employment in brackets.
